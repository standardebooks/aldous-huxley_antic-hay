			<p>The blackamoors had left the platform at the end of the hall. The curtains looped up at either side had slid down, cutting it off from the rest of the room⁠—“making two worlds,” Gumbril elegantly and allusively put it, “where only one grew before⁠—and one of them a better world,” he added too philosophically, “because unreal.” There was the theatrical silence, the suspense. The curtains parted again.</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:scene">
				<p>On a narrow bed⁠—on a bier perhaps⁠—the corpse of a woman. The husband kneels beside it. At the foot stands the doctor, putting away his instruments. In a beribboned pink cradle reposes a monstrous baby.</p>

			<p>“A little ponderous, perhaps,” said Gumbril, as the curtain came down.</p>
			<p>“But I liked the cow.” <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Viveash opened her cigarette-case and found it empty. Gumbril offered her one of his. She shook her head. “I don’t want it in the least,” she said.</p>
			<p>“Yes, the cow was in the best pantomime tradition,” Gumbril agreed. Ah! but it was a long time since he had been to a Christmas pantomime. Not since Dan Leno’s days. All the little cousins, the uncles and aunts on both sides of the family, dozens and dozens of them⁠—every year they filled the best part of a row in the dress circle at Drury Lane. And buns were stickily passed from hand to hand, chocolates circulated; the grownups drank tea. And the pantomime went on and on, glory after glory, under the shining arch of the stage. Hours and hours; and the grownups always wanted to go away before the harlequinade. And the children felt sick from eating too much chocolate, or wanted with such extreme urgency to go to the <abbr>w.c.</abbr> that they had to be led out, trampling and stumbling over everybody else’s feet⁠—and every stumble making the need more agonizingly great⁠—in the middle of the transformation scene. And there was Dan Leno, inimitable Dan Leno, dead now as poor Yorick, no more than a mere skull like anybody else’s skull. And his mother, he remembered, used to laugh at him sometimes till the tears ran down her cheeks. She used to enjoy things thoroughly, with a whole heart.</p>
			<p>“I wish they’d hurry up with the second scene,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Viveash. “If there’s anything that bores me, it’s entr’actes.”</p>
			<p>“Most of one’s life is an entr’acte,” said Gumbril, whose present mood of hilarious depression seemed favourable to the enunciation of apophthegms.</p>
			<p>“None of your cracker mottoes, please,” protested <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Viveash. All the same, she reflected, what was she doing now but waiting for the curtain to go up again, waiting, with what unspeakable weariness of spirit, for the curtain that had rung down, ten centuries ago, on those blue eyes, that bright strawy hair and the weathered face?</p>
			<p>“Thank God,” she said with an expiring earnestness, “here’s the second scene!”</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:scene">
				<p>The curtain went up. In a bald room stood the Monster, grown now from an infant into a frail and bent young man with bandy legs. At the back of the stage a large window giving on to a street along which people pass.</p>

								<p>The young girls of Sparta, they say, used to wrestle naked with naked Spartan boys. The sun caressed their skins till they were brown and transparent like amber or a flask of olive oil. Their breasts were hard, their bellies flat. They were pure with the chastity of beautiful animals. Their thoughts were clear, their minds cool and untroubled. I spit blood into my handkerchief and sometimes I feel in my mouth something slimy, soft and disgusting, like a slug⁠—and I have coughed up a shred of my lung. The rickets from which I suffered in childhood have bent my bones and made them old and brittle. All my life I have lived in this huge town, whose domes and spires are wrapped in a cloud of stink that hides the sun. The slug-dank tatters of lung that I spit out are black with the soot I have been breathing all these years. I am now come of age. Long-expected one-and-twenty has made me a fully privileged citizen of this great realm of which the owners of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Daily Mirror</i>, the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">News of the World</i> and the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Daily Express</i> are noble peers. Somewhere, I must logically infer, there must be other cities, built by men for men to live in. Somewhere, in the past, in the future, a very long way off.⁠ ⁠… But perhaps the only street improvement schemes that ever really improve the streets are schemes in the minds of those who live in them: schemes of love mostly.

								<p>She is like a pear tree in flower. When she smiles, it is as though there were stars. Her hair is like the harvest in an eclogue, her cheeks are all the fruits of summer. Her arms and thighs are as beautiful as the soul of <abbr>St.</abbr> Catherine of Siena. And her eyes, her eyes are plumbless with thought and limpidly pure like the water of the mountains.</p>

			<p>“And about time too!” declared <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Viveash.</p>
			<p>“Charming!” Gumbril stuck to his guns. “Charming! charming!”</p>
			<p>There was a disturbance near the door. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Viveash looked round to see what was happening. “And now on top of it all,” she said, “here comes Coleman, raving, with an unknown drunk.”</p>
			<p>“Have we missed it?” Coleman was shouting. “Have we missed all the lovely bloody farce?”</p>
			<p>“Lovely bloody!” his companion repeated with drunken raptures, and he went into fits of uncontrollable laughter. He was a very young boy with straight dark hair and a face of Hellenic beauty, now distorted with tipsiness.</p>
			<p>Coleman greeted his acquaintances in the hall, shouting a jovial obscenity to each. “And Bumbril-Gumbril,” he exclaimed, catching sight of him at last in the front row. “And Hetaira-Myra!” He pushed his way through the crowd, followed unsteadily by his young disciple. “So you’re here,” he said, standing over them and looking down with an enigmatic malice in his bright blue eyes. “Where’s the physiologue?”</p>
			<p>“Am I the physiologue’s keeper?” asked Gumbril. “He’s with his glands and his hormones, I suppose. Not to mention his wife.” He smiled to himself.</p>
			<p>“Where the hormones, there moan I,” said Coleman, skidding off sideways along the slippery word. “I hear, by the way, that there’s a lovely prostitute in this play.”</p>
			<p>“You’ve missed her,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Viveash.</p>
			<p>“What a misfortune,” said Coleman. “We’ve missed the delicious trull,” he said, turning to the young man.</p>
			<p>The young man only laughed.</p>
			<p>“Let me introduce, by the way,” said Coleman. “This is Dante,” he pointed to the dark-haired boy; “and I am Virgil. We’re making a round tour⁠—or, rather, a descending spiral tour of hell. But we’re only at the first circle so far. These, Alighieri, are two damned souls, though not, as you might suppose, Paolo and Francesca.”</p>
			<p>The boy continued to laugh, happily and uncomprehendingly.</p>
			<p>“Another of these interminable entr’actes,” complained <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Viveash. “I was just saying to Theodore here that if there’s one thing I dislike more than another, it’s a long entr’acte.” Would hers ever come to an end?</p>
			<p>“And if there’s one thing <em>I</em> dislike more than another,” said the boy, breaking silence for the first time, with an air of the greatest earnestness, “it’s⁠ ⁠… it’s one thing more than another.”</p>
			<p>“And you’re perfectly right in doing so,” said Coleman. “Perfectly right.”</p>
			<p>“I know,” the boy replied modestly.</p>

								<p>Asses, apes and dogs! Milton called them that; he should have known. Somewhere there must be men, however. The variations on Diabelli prove it.

			<p>“Well,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Viveash, “I’m glad that’s over.”</p>
			<p>The music struck up again, saxophone and cello, with the thin draught of the violin to cool their ecstasies and the thumping piano to remind them of business. Gumbril and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Viveash slid out into the dancing crowd, revolving as though by force of habit.</p>
			<p>“These substitutes for the genuine copulative article,” said Coleman to his disciple, “are beneath the dignity of hellhounds like you and me.”</p>
			<p>Charmed, the young man laughed; he was attentive as though at the feet of Socrates. Coleman had found him in a night club, where he had gone in search of Zoe, found him very drunk in the company of two formidable women fifteen or twenty years his senior, who were looking after him, half maternally out of pure kindness of heart, half professionally; for he seemed to be carrying a good deal of money. He was incapable of looking after himself. Coleman had pounced on him at once, claimed an old friendship which the youth was too tipsy to be able to deny, and carried him off. There was something, he always thought, peculiarly interesting about the spectacle of children tobogganing down into the cesspools.</p>
			<p>“I like this place,” said the young man.</p>
			<p>“Tastes differ!” Coleman shrugged his shoulders. “The German professors have catalogued thousands of people whose whole pleasure consists in eating dung.”</p>
			<p>The young man smiled and nodded, rather vaguely. “Is there anything to drink here?” he asked.</p>
			<p>“Too respectable,” Coleman answered, shaking his head.</p>
			<p>“I think this is a bloody place,” said the young man.</p>
			<p>“Ah! but some people like blood. And some like boots. And some like long gloves and corsets. And some like birch-rods. And some like sliding down slopes and can’t look at Michelangelo’s <i epub:type="se:name.visual-art.sculpture">Night</i> on the Medici Tombs without dying the little death, because the statue seems to be sliding. And some.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“But I want something to drink,” insisted the young man.</p>
			<p>Coleman stamped his feet, waved his arms. “<i xml:lang="fr">À boire! à boire!</i>” he shouted, like the newborn Gargantua. Nobody paid any attention.</p>
			<p>The music came to an end. Gumbril and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Viveash reappeared.</p>
			<p>“Dante,” said Coleman, “calls for drink. We must leave the building.”</p>
			<p>“Yes. Anything to get out of this,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Viveash. “What’s the time?”</p>
			<p>Gumbril looked at his watch. “Half-past one.”</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Viveash sighed. “Can’t possibly go to bed,” she said, “for another hour at least.”</p>
			<p>They walked out into the street. The stars were large and brilliant overhead. There was a little wind that almost seemed to come from the country. Gumbril thought so, at any rate; he thought of the country.</p>
			<p>“The question is, where?” said Coleman. “You can come to my bordello, if you like; but it’s a long way off and Zoe hates us all so much, she’ll probably set on us with the meat-chopper. If she’s back again, that is. Though she may be out all night. <i xml:lang="el-Latn">Zoe mou, sas agapo.</i> Shall we risk it?”</p>
			<p>“To me it’s quite indifferent,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Viveash faintly, as though wholly preoccupied with expiring.</p>
			<p>“Or there’s my place,” Gumbril said abruptly, as though shaking himself awake out of some dream.</p>
			<p>“But you live still farther, don’t you?” said Coleman. “With venerable parents, and so forth. One foot in the grave and all that. Shall we mingle hornpipes with funerals?” He began to hum Chopin’s “Funeral March” at three times its proper speed, and seizing the young stranger in his arms, two-stepped two or three turns on the pavement, then released his hold and let him go reeling against the area railings.</p>
			<p>“No, I don’t mean the family mansion,” said Gumbril. “I mean my own rooms. They’re quite near. In Great Russell Street.”</p>
			<p>“I never knew you had any rooms, Theodore,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Viveash.</p>
			<p>“Nobody did.” Why should they know now? Because the wind seemed almost a country wind? “There’s drink there,” he said.</p>
			<p>“Splendid!” cried the young man. They were all splendid people.</p>
			<p>“There’s some gin,” said Gumbril.</p>
			<p>“Capital aphrodisiac!” Coleman commented.</p>
			<p>“Some light white wine.”</p>
			<p>“Diuretic.”</p>
			<p>“And some whisky.”</p>
			<p>“The great emetic,” said Coleman. “Come on.” And he struck up the March of the Fascisti. “<i xml:lang="it">Giovinezza, giovinezza, primavera di bellezza.⁠ ⁠…</i>” The noise went fading down the dark, empty streets.</p>
			<p>The gin, the white wine, and even, for the sake of the young stranger, who wanted to sample everything, the emetic whisky, were produced.</p>
			<p>“I like your rooms,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Viveash, looking round her. “And I resent your secrecy about them, Theodore.”</p>
			<p>“Drink, puppy!” Coleman refilled the boy’s glass.</p>
			<p>“Here’s to secrecy,” Gumbril proposed. Shut it tightly, keep it dark, cover it up. Be silent, prevaricate, lie outright. He laughed and drank. “Do you remember,” he went on, “those instructive advertisements of Eno’s Fruit Salt they used to have when we were young? There was one little anecdote about a doctor who advised the hypochondriacal patient who had come to consult him, to go and see Grimaldi, the clown; and the patient answered, ‘I am Grimaldi.’ Do you remember?”</p>
			<p>“No,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Viveash. “And why do you?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, I don’t know. Or rather, I do know,” Gumbril corrected himself, and laughed again.</p>
			<p>The young man suddenly began to boast. “I lost two hundred pounds yesterday playing <i xml:lang="fr">chemin de fer</i>,” he said, and looked round for applause.</p>
			<p>Coleman patted his curly head. “Delicious child!” he said. “You’re positively Hogarthian.”</p>
			<p>Angrily, the boy pushed him away. “What are you doing?” he shouted; then turned and addressed himself once more to the others. “I couldn’t afford it, you know⁠—not a bloody penny of it. Not my money, either.” He seemed to find it exquisitely humorous. “And that two hundred wasn’t all,” he added, almost expiring with mirth.</p>
			<p>“Tell Coleman how you borrowed his beard, Theodore.”</p>
			<p>Gumbril was looking intently into his glass, as though he hoped to see in its pale mixture of gin and Sauterne visions, as in a crystal, of the future. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Viveash touched him on the arm and repeated her injunction.</p>
			<p>“Oh, that!” said Gumbril rather irritably. “No. It isn’t an interesting story.”</p>
			<p>“Oh yes, it is! I insist,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Viveash, commanding peremptorily from her deathbed.</p>
			<p>Gumbril drank his gin and Sauterne. “Very well then,” he said reluctantly, and began.</p>
			<p>“I don’t know what my governor will say,” the young man put in once or twice. But nobody paid any attention to him. He relapsed into a sulky and, it seemed to him, very dignified silence. Under the warm, jolly tipsiness he felt a chill of foreboding. He poured out some more whisky.</p>
			<p>Gumbril warmed to his anecdote. Expiringly <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Viveash laughed from time to time, or smiled her agonizing smile. Coleman whooped like a Redskin.</p>
			<p>“And after the concert to these rooms,” said Gumbril.</p>
			<p>Well, let everything go. Into the mud. Leave it there, and let the dogs lift their hind legs over it as they pass.</p>
			<p>“Ah! the genuine platonic fumblers,” commented Coleman.</p>
			<p>“I am Grimaldi,” Gumbril laughed. Further than this it was difficult to see where the joke could go. There, on the couch, where <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Viveash and Coleman were now sitting, she had lain sleeping in his arms.</p>
			<p>“Towsing, in Elizabethan,” said Coleman.</p>
			<p>Unreal, eternal in the secret darkness. A night that was an eternal parenthesis among the other nights and days.</p>
			<p>“I feel I’m going to be sick,” said the young man suddenly. He had wanted to go on silently and haughtily sulking; but his stomach declined to take part in the dignified game.</p>
			<p>“Good Lord!” said Gumbril, and jumped up. But before he could do anything effective, the young man had fulfilled his own prophecy.</p>
			<p>“The real charm about debauchery,” said Coleman philosophically, “is its total pointlessness, futility, and above all its incredible tediousness. If it really were all roses and exhilaration, as these poor children seem to imagine, it would be no better than going to church or studying the higher mathematics. I should never touch a drop of wine or another harlot again. It would be against my principles. I told you it was emetic,” he called to the young man.</p>
			<p>“And what are your principles?” asked <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Viveash.</p>
			<p>“Oh, strictly ethical,” said Coleman.</p>
			<p>“You’re responsible for this creature,” said Gumbril, pointing to the young man, who was sitting on the floor near the fireplace, cooling his forehead against the marble of the mantelpiece. “You must take him away. Really, what a bore!” His nose and mouth were all wrinkled up with disgust.</p>
			<p>“I’m sorry,” the young man whispered. He kept his eyes shut and his face was exceedingly pale.</p>
			<p>“But with pleasure,” said Coleman. “What’s your name?” he asked the young man, “and where do you live?”</p>
			<p>“My name is Porteous,” murmured the young man.</p>
			<p>“Good lord!” cried Gumbril, letting himself fall on to the couch beside <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Viveash. “That’s the last straw!”</p>
