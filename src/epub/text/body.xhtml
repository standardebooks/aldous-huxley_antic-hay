<h2 class="c008">CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>
<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c009">Gumbril, Theodore Gumbril Junior, B.A. Oxon.,
sat in his oaken stall on the north side of the
School Chapel and wondered, as he listened
through the uneasy silence of half a thousand schoolboys
to the First Lesson, pondered, as he looked up at the vast
window opposite, all blue and jaundiced and bloody with
nineteenth-century glass, speculated in his rapid and
rambling way about the existence and the nature of God.</p>
<p class="c010">Standing in front of the spread brass eagle and fortified
in his convictions by the sixth chapter of Deuteronomy
(for this first Sunday of term was the Fifth after Easter),
the Reverend Pelvey could speak of these things with an
enviable certainty. “Hear, O Israel,” he was booming
out over the top of the portentous Book: “the Lord our
God is one Lord.”</p>
<p class="c010">One Lord; Mr. Pelvey knew; he had studied theology.
But if theology and theosophy, then why not theography
and theometry, why not theognomy, theotrophy, theotomy,
theogamy? Why not theophysics and theo-chemistry?
Why not that ingenious toy, the theotrope or wheel of
gods? Why not a monumental theodrome?</p>
<p class="c010">In the great window opposite, young David stood like a
cock, crowing on the dunghill of a tumbled giant. From
the middle of Goliath’s forehead there issued, like a narwhal’s
budding horn, a curious excrescence. Was it the
embedded pebble? Or perhaps the giant’s married life?</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_4">4</span>“... with all thine heart,” declaimed the Reverend
Pelvey, “and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.”</p>
<p class="c010">No, but seriously, Gumbril reminded himself, the problem
was very troublesome indeed. God as a sense of warmth
about the heart, God as exultation, God as tears in the
eyes, God as a rush of power or thought—that was all right.
But God as truth, God as 2 + 2 = 4—that wasn’t so clearly
all right. Was there any chance of their being the same?
Were there bridges to join the two worlds? And could
it be that the Reverend Pelvey, M.A., fog-horning away
from behind the imperial bird, could it be that he had an
answer and a clue? That was hardly believable. Particularly
if one knew Mr. Pelvey personally. And Gumbril
did.</p>
<p class="c010">“And these words which I command thee this day,”
retorted Mr. Pelvey, “shall be in thine heart.”</p>
<p class="c010">Or in the heart, or in the head? Reply, Mr. Pelvey,
reply. Gumbril jumped between the horns of the dilemma
and voted for other organs.</p>
<p class="c010">“And thou shalt teach them diligently to thy children,
and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and
when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down,
and when thou risest up.”</p>
<p class="c010">Diligently to thy children.... Gumbril remembered
his own childhood; they had not been very diligently
taught to him. ‘Beetles, black beetles’—his father had
a really passionate feeling about the clergy. Mumbojumbery
was another of his favourite words. An atheist
and an anti-clerical of the strict old school he was. Not
that, in any case, he gave himself much time to think about
these things; he was too busy being an unsuccessful architect.
As for Gumbril’s mother, her diligence had not
<span class="pageno" id="Page_5">5</span>been dogmatic. She had just been diligently good, that
was all. Good; good? It was a word people only used
nowadays with a kind of deprecating humorousness. Good.
Beyond good and evil? We are all that nowadays. Or
merely below them, like earwigs? I glory in the name of
earwig. Gumbril made a mental gesture and inwardly
declaimed. But good in any case, there was no getting
out of that, good she had been. Not nice, not merely
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">molto simpatica</span></i>—how charmingly and effectively these
foreign tags assist one in the great task of calling a spade by
some other name!—but good. You felt the active radiance
of her goodness when you were near her.... And that
feeling, was that less real and valid than two plus two?</p>
<p class="c010">The Reverend Pelvey had nothing to reply. He was
reading with a holy gusto of “houses full of all good things,
which thou filledst not, and wells digged, which thou
diggedst not, vineyards and olive trees, which thou
plantedst not.”</p>
<p class="c010">She had been good and she had died when he was still a
boy; died—but he hadn’t been told that till much later—of
creeping and devouring pain. Malignant disease—oh,
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">caro nome</span></i>!</p>
<p class="c010">“Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God,” said Mr. Pelvey.</p>
<p class="c010">Even when the ulcers are benign; thou shalt fear. He
had travelled up from school to see her, just before she
died. He hadn’t known that she was going to die, but
when he entered her room, when he saw her lying so weakly
in the bed, he had suddenly begun to cry, uncontrollably.
All the fortitude, the laughter even, had been hers. And
she had spoken to him. A few words only; but they had
contained all the wisdom he needed to live by. She had
told him what he was, and what he should try to be, and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_6">6</span>how to be it. And crying, still crying, he had promised
that he would try.</p>
<p class="c010">“And the Lord commanded us to do all these statutes,”
said Mr. Pelvey, “for our good always, that he might
preserve us alive, as it is at this day.”</p>
<p class="c010">And had he kept his promise, Gumbril wondered, had
he preserved himself alive?</p>
<p class="c010">“Here endeth the First Lesson.” Mr. Pelvey retreated
from the eagle, and the organ presaged the coming <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te Deum</span></cite>.</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril hoisted himself to his feet; the folds of his B.A.
gown billowed nobly about him as he rose. He sighed
and shook his head with the gesture of one who tries to
shake off a fly or an importunate thought. When the
time came for singing, he sang. On the opposite side of
the chapel two boys were grinning and whispering to one
another behind their lifted Prayer Books. Gumbril frowned
at them ferociously. The two boys caught his eye and
their faces at once took on an expression of sickly piety;
they began to sing with unction. They were two ugly,
stupid-looking louts, who ought to have been apprenticed
years ago to some useful trade. Instead of which they were
wasting their own and their teacher’s and their more intelligent
comrades’ time in trying, quite vainly, to acquire an
elegant literary education. The minds of dogs, Gumbril
reflected, do not benefit by being treated as though they
were the minds of men.</p>
<p class="c010">“O Lord, have mercy upon us: have mercy upon us.”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril shrugged his shoulders and looked round the
chapel at the faces of the boys. Lord, indeed, have mercy
upon us! He was disturbed to find the sentiment echoed
on a somewhat different note in the Second Lesson, which
was drawn from the twenty-third chapter of St. Luke.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_7">7</span>“Father, forgive them,” said Mr. Pelvey in his unvaryingly
juicy voice; “for they know not what they do.” Ah,
but suppose one did know what one was doing? suppose
one knew only too well? And of course one always did
know. One was not a fool.</p>
<p class="c010">But this was all nonsense, all nonsense. One must think
of something better than this. What a comfort it would
be, for example, if one could bring air cushions into
chapel! These polished oaken stalls were devilishly hard;
they were meant for stout and lusty pedagogues, not for bony
starvelings like himself. An air cushion, a delicious pneu.</p>
<p class="c010">“Here endeth,” boomed Mr. Pelvey, closing his book on
the back of the German eagle.</p>
<p class="c010">As if by magic, Dr. Jolly was ready at the organ with the
<cite>Benedictus</cite>. It was positively a relief to stand again; this
oak was adamantine. But air cushions, alas, would be too
bad an example for the boys. Hardy young Spartans!
it was an essential part of their education that they should
listen to the word of revelation without pneumatic easement.
No, air cushions wouldn’t do. The real remedy, it
suddenly flashed across his mind, would be trousers with
pneumatic seats. For all occasions; not merely for churchgoing.</p>
<p class="c010">The organ blew a thin Puritan-preacher’s note through
one of its hundred nostrils. “I believe....” With a noise
like the breaking of a wave, five hundred turned towards
the East. The view of David and Goliath was exchanged
for a Crucifixion in the grand manner of eighteen hundred
and sixty. “Father, forgive them; for they know not
what they do.” No, no, Gumbril preferred to look at the
grooved stonework rushing smoothly up on either side of
the great east window towards the vaulted roof; preferred
<span class="pageno" id="Page_8">8</span>to reflect, like the dutiful son of an architect he was, that
Perpendicular at its best—and its best is its largest—is the
finest sort of English Gothic. At its worst and smallest,
as in most of the colleges of Oxford, it is mean, petty, and,
but for a certain picturesqueness, almost wholly disgusting.
He felt like a lecturer: next slide, please. “And the life
everlasting. Amen.” Like an oboe, Mr. Pelvey intoned:
“The Lord be with you.”</p>
<p class="c010">For prayer, Gumbril reflected, there would be Dunlop
knees. Still, in the days when he had made a habit of
praying, they hadn’t been necessary. “Our Father....”
The words were the same as they were in the old days;
but Mr. Pelvey’s method of reciting them made them sound
rather different. Her dresses, when he had leaned his
forehead against her knee to say those words—those words,
good Lord! that Mr. Pelvey was oboeing out of existence—were
always black in the evenings, and of silk, and smelt of
orris root. And when she was dying, she had said to him:
“Remember the Parable of the Sower, and the seeds that
fell in shallow ground.” No, no. Amen, decidedly.
“O Lord, show thy mercy upon us,” chanted oboe Pelvey,
and Gumbril trombone responded, profoundly and
grotesquely: “And grant us thy salvation.” No, the
knees were obviously less important, except for people like
revivalists and housemaids, than the seat. Sedentary are
commoner than genuflectory professions. One would
introduce little flat rubber bladders between two layers of
cloth. At the upper end, hidden when one wore a coat,
would be a tube with a valve: like a hollow tail. Blow
it up—and there would be perfect comfort even for the
boniest, even on rock. How did the Greeks stand marble
benches in their theatres?</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_9">9</span>The moment had now come for the Hymn. This being
the first Sunday of the Summer term, they sang that special
hymn, written by the Headmaster, with music by Dr. Jolly,
on purpose to be sung on the first Sundays of terms.
The organ quietly sketched out the tune. Simple it was,
uplifting and manly.</p>

<p class="c010">Five hundred flawed adolescent voices took it up. For
good example’s sake, Gumbril opened and closed his mouth;
noiselessly, however. It was only at the third verse that
he gave rein to his uncertain baritone. He particularly
liked the third verse; it marked, in his opinion, the Headmaster’s
highest poetical achievement.</p>

<p class="c010">At this point Dr. Jolly enriched his tune with a thick
accompaniment in the lower registers, artfully designed to
symbolize the depth, the gloom and general repulsiveness
of the Tempter’s home.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="c010">Work, thought Gumbril, work. Lord, how passionately
he disliked work! Let Austin have his swink to him reserved!
Ah, if only one had work of one’s own, proper
<span class="pageno" id="Page_10">10</span>work, decent work—not forced upon one by the griping
of one’s belly! Amen! Dr. Jolly blew the two sumptuous
jets of reverence into the air; Gumbril accompanied them
with all his heart. Amen, indeed.</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril sat down again. It might be convenient, he
thought, to have the tail so long that one could blow up
one’s trousers while one actually had them on. In which
case, it would have to be coiled round the waist like a belt;
or looped up, perhaps, and fastened to a clip on one’s braces.</p>
<p class="c010">“The nineteenth chapter of the Acts of the Apostles,
part of the thirty-fourth verse.” The Headmaster’s loud,
harsh voice broke violently out from the pulpit. “All
with one voice for the space of about two hours cried out,
Great is Diana of the Ephesians.”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril composed himself as comfortably as he could
on his oaken seat. It was going to be one of the Headmaster’s
real swingeing sermons. Great is Diana. And
Venus? Ah, these seats, these seats!</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril did not attend evening chapel. He stayed at
home in his lodgings to correct the sixty-three Holiday
Task Papers which had fallen to his share. They lay,
thick piles of them, on the floor beside his chair: sixty-three
answers to ten questions about the Italian Risorgimento.
The Risorgimento, of all subjects! It had been
one of the Headmaster’s caprices. He had called a special
master’s meeting at the end of last term to tell them all
about the Risorgimento. It was his latest discovery.</p>
<p class="c010">“The Risorgimento, gentlemen, is the most important
event in modern European history.” And he had banged
the table; he had looked defiantly round the room in search
of contradictors.</p>
<p class="c010">But nobody had contradicted him. Nobody ever did;
<span class="pageno" id="Page_11">11</span>they all knew better. For the Headmaster was as fierce
as he was capricious. He was for ever discovering something
new. Two terms ago it had been singeing; after the
hair-cut and before the shampoo, there must be singeing.</p>
<p class="c010">“The hair, gentlemen, is a tube. If you cut it and leave
the end unsealed, the water will get in and rot the tube.
Hence the importance of singeing, gentlemen. Singeing
seals the tube. I shall address the boys about it after chapel
to-morrow morning; and I trust that all house-masters”—and
he had glared around him from under his savage eyebrows—“will
see that their boys get themselves regularly
singed after cutting.”</p>
<p class="c010">For weeks afterwards every boy trailed behind him a
faint and nauseating whiff of burning, as though he were
fresh from hell. And now it was the Risorgimento. One
of these days, Gumbril reflected, it would be birth control,
or the decimal system, or rational dress.</p>
<p class="c010">He picked up the nearest batch of papers. The printed
questions were pinned to the topmost of them.</p>
<p class="c010">“Give a brief account of the character and career of
Pope Pius IX, <em>with dates wherever possible</em>.”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril leaned back in his chair and thought of his own
character, with dates. 1896: the first serious and conscious
and deliberate lie. Did you break that vase, Theodore?
No, mother. It lay on his conscience for nearly a month,
eating deeper and deeper. Then he had confessed the
truth. Or rather he had not confessed; that was too
difficult. He led the conversation, very subtly, as he
thought, round through the non-malleability of glass,
through breakages in general, to this particular broken
vase; he practically forced his mother to repeat her
question. And then, with a burst of tears, he had answered,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_12">12</span>yes. It had always been difficult for him to say things
directly, point-blank. His mother had told him, when she
was dying.... No, no; not that.</p>
<p class="c010">In 1898 or 1899—oh, these dates!—he had made a pact
with his little cousin, Molly, that she should let him see
her with no clothes on, if he would do the same by her.
She had fulfilled her part of the bargain; but he, overwhelmed
at the last moment by a passion of modesty, had
broken his promise.</p>
<p class="c010">Then, when he was about twelve and still at his preparatory
school, in 1902 or 1903 he had done badly in his
exams., on purpose; he had been frightened of Sadler,
who was in the same form, and wanted to get the prize.
Sadler was stronger than he was, and had a genius for
persecution. He had done so badly that his mother was
unhappy; and it was impossible for him to explain.</p>
<p class="c010">In 1906 he had fallen in love for the first time—ah,
much more violently than ever since—with a boy of his
own age. Platonic it had been and profound. He had
done badly that term, too; not on purpose, but because
he had spent so much time helping young Vickers with his
work. Vickers was really very stupid. The next term he
had ‘come out’—<em>Staphylococcus pyogenes</em> is a lover of growing
adolescence—with spots and boils all over his face
and neck. Gumbril’s affection ceased as suddenly as it
had begun. He finished that term, he remembered, with
a second prize.</p>
<p class="c010">But it was time to be thinking seriously of Pio Nono.
With a sigh of disgusted weariness, Gumbril looked at his
papers. What had Falarope Major to say of the Pontiff?
“Pius IX was called Ferretti. He was a liberal before he
was a Pope. A kindly man of less than average intelligence,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_13">13</span>he thought that all difficulties could be settled by
a little goodwill, a few reforms and a political amnesty.
He wrote several encyclicals and a syllabus.” Gumbril
admired the phrase about less than average intelligence;
Falarope Major should have at least one mark for having
learnt it so well by heart. He turned to the next paper.
Higgs was of opinion that “Pius the Ninth was a good but
stupid man, who thought he could settle the Risorgimento
with a few reforms and a political armistice.” Beddoes
was severer. “Pius IX was a bad man, who said that he
was infallible, which showed he had a less than average
intelligence.” Sopwith Minor shared the general opinion
about Pio’s intelligence, and displayed a great familiarity
with the wrong dates. Clegg-Weller was voluminous and
informative. “Pius IX was not so clever as his prime
minister, Cardinal Antonelli. When he came to the tiara
he was a liberal, and Metternich said he had never reckoned
on a liberal pope. He then became a conservative. He
was kindly, but not intelligent, and he thought Garibaldi
and Cavour would be content with a few reforms and an
amnesty.” At the top of Garstang’s paper was written:
“I have had measles all the holidays, so have been unable
to read more than the first thirty pages of the book. Pope
Pius IX does not come into these pages, of the contents of
which I will proceed to give the following précis.” And the
précis duly followed. Gumbril would have liked to give
him full marks. But the business-like answer of Appleyard
called him back to a better sense of his duty. “Pius IX
became Pope in 1846 and died in 1878. He was a kindly
man, but his intelligence was below the....”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril laid the paper down and shut his eyes. No,
this was really impossible. Definitely, it couldn’t go on,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_14">14</span>it could not go on. There were thirteen weeks in the
summer term, there would be thirteen in the autumn and
eleven or twelve in the spring; and then another summer of
thirteen, and so it would go on for ever. For ever. It
wouldn’t do. He would go away and live uncomfortably
on his three hundred. Or, no, he would go away and he
would make money—that was more like it—money on a
large scale, easily; he would be free and he would live.
For the first time, he would live. Behind his closed eyes,
he saw himself living.</p>
<p class="c010">Over the plushy floors of some vast and ignoble Ritz
slowly he walked, at ease, with confidence: over the plushy
floors and there, at the end of a long vista, there was Myra
Viveash, waiting, this time, for him; coming forward
impatiently to meet him, his abject lover now, not the cool,
free, laughing mistress who had lent herself contemptuously
once to his pathetic and silent importunity and then, after
a day, withdrawn the gift again. Over the plushy floors
to dine. Not that he was in love with Myra any longer:
but revenge is sweet.</p>
<p class="c010">He sat in his own house. The Chinese statues looked
out from the niches; the Maillols passionately meditated,
slept, and were more than alive. The Goyas hung on the
walls, there was a Boucher in the bathroom; and when he
entered with his guests, what a Piazzetta exploded above
the dining-room mantelpiece! Over the ancient wine
they talked together, and he knew everything they knew
and more; he gave, he inspired, it was the others who
assimilated and were enriched. After dinner there were
Mozart quartets; he opened his portfolios and showed
his Daumiers, his Tiepolos, his Canaletto sketches, his
drawings by Picasso and Lewis, and the purity of his naked
<span class="pageno" id="Page_15">15</span>Ingres. And later, talking of Odalisques, there were orgies
without fatigue or disgust, and the women were pictures
and lust in action, art.</p>
<p class="c010">Over the empty plains forty horses impelled him towards
Mantua: rubadub—adubadub, with the silencer out.
Towards the most romantic city in all the world.</p>
<p class="c010">When he spoke to women—how easily and insolently he
spoke now!—they listened and laughed and looked at him
sideways and dropped their eyelids over the admission, the
invitation, of their glance. With Phyllis once he had sat,
for how long? in a warm and moonless darkness, saying
nothing, risking no gesture. And in the end they had
parted, reluctantly and still in silence. Phyllis now was
with him once again in the summer night; but this time
he spoke, now softly, now in the angry breathless whisper
of desire, he reached out and took her, and she was naked
in his arms. All chance encounters, all plotted opportunities
recurred; he knew, now, how to live, how to take
advantage of them.</p>
<p class="c010">Over the empty plains towards Mantua, towards Mantua,
he slid along at ease, free and alone. He explored the
horrors of Roman society; visited Athens and Seville.
To Unamuno and Papini he conversed familiarly in their
own tongues. He understood perfectly and without effort
the quantum theory. To his friend Shearwater he gave
half a million for physiological research. He visited
Schoenberg and persuaded him to write still better music.
He exhibited to the politicians the full extent of their
stupidity and their wickedness; he set them working for
the salvation, not the destruction, of humanity. Once in
the past when he had been called upon to make a public
speech, he had felt so nervous that he was sick; the thousands
<span class="pageno" id="Page_16">16</span>who listened to him now bent like wheat under the wind
of his eloquence. But it was only by the way and occasionally
that he troubled himself to move them. He found
it easy now to come to terms with every one he met, to
understand all points of view, to identify himself with even
the most unfamiliar spirit. And he knew how everybody
lived, and what it was like to be a mill girl, a dustman, an
engine-driver, a Jew, an Anglican bishop, a confidence-trickster.
Accustomed as he was to being swindled and
imposed upon without protest, he now knew the art of
being brutal. He was just dressing down that insolent porter
at the Continental, who had complained that ten francs
wasn’t enough (and had got, as a matter of historic fact,
another five in addition), when his landlady gave a knock,
opened the door and said: “Dinner’s ready, Mr. Gumbril.”</p>
<p class="c010">Feeling a little ashamed at having been interrupted in
what was, after all, one of the ignobler and more trivial
occupations of his new life, Gumbril went down to his fatty
chop and green peas. It was the first meal to be eaten
under the new dispensation; he ate it, for all that it was
unhappily indistinguishable from the meals of the past,
with elation and a certain solemnity, as though he were
partaking of a sacrament. He felt buoyant with the thought
that at last, at last, he was doing something about life.</p>
<p class="c010">When the chop was eaten, he went upstairs and, after
filling two suit-cases and a Gladstone bag with the most
valued of his possessions, addressed himself to the task of
writing to the Headmaster. He might have gone away, of
course, without writing. But it would be nobler, more in
keeping, he felt, with his new life, to leave a justification
behind—or rather not a justification, a denouncement.
He picked up his pen and denounced.</p>
<div class="chapter">
<span class="pageno" id="Page_17">17</span>
<h2 class="c008">CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>
<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c009">Gumbril senior occupied a tall, narrow-shouldered
and rachitic house in a little obscure
square not far from Paddington. There were
five floors, and a basement with beetles, and nearly a
hundred stairs, which shook when any one ran too rudely
down them. It was a prematurely old and decaying house
in a decaying quarter. The square in which it stood was
steadily coming down in the world. The houses which a
few years ago had all been occupied by respectable families,
were now split up into squalid little maisonnettes, and from
the neighbouring slums, which along with most other
unpleasant things the old bourgeois families had been able
to ignore, invading bands of children came to sport on
the once sacred pavements.</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Gumbril was almost the last survivor of the old
inhabitants. He liked his house, and he liked his square.
Social decadence had not affected the fourteen plane trees
which adorned its little garden, and the gambols of the dirty
children did not disturb the starlings who came, evening
by evening in summer-time, to roost in their branches.</p>
<p class="c010">On fine evenings he used to sit out on his balcony waiting
for the coming of the birds. And just at sunset, when the
sky was most golden, there would be a twittering overhead,
and the black, innumerable flocks of starlings would come
sweeping across on the way from their daily haunts to their
roosting-places, chosen so capriciously among the tree-planted
<span class="pageno" id="Page_18">18</span>squares and gardens of the city and so tenaciously
retained, year after year, to the exclusion of every other
place. Why his fourteen plane trees should have been
chosen, Mr. Gumbril could never imagine. There were
plenty of larger and more umbrageous gardens all round;
but they remained birdless, while every evening, from the
larger flocks, a faithful legion detached itself to settle
clamorously among his trees. They sat and chattered
till the sun went down and twilight was past, with intervals
every now and then of silence that fell suddenly and
inexplicably on all the birds at once, lasted through a few
seconds of thrilling suspense, to end as suddenly and senselessly
in an outburst of the same loud and simultaneous
conversation.</p>
<p class="c010">The starlings were Mr. Gumbril’s most affectionately
cherished friends; sitting out on his balcony to watch and
listen to them, he had caught at the shut of treacherous
evenings many colds and chills on the liver, he had laid
up for himself many painful hours of rheumatism. These
little accidents did nothing, however, to damp his affection
for the birds; and still on every evening that could possibly
be called fine, he was always to be seen in the twilight,
sitting on the balcony, gazing up, round-spectacled and
rapt, at the fourteen plane trees. The breezes stirred in
his grey hair, tossing it up in long, light wisps that fell
across his forehead and over his spectacles; and then he
would shake his head impatiently, and the bony hand would
be freed for a moment from its unceasing combing and
clutching of the sparse grey beard to push back the strayed
tendrils, to smooth and reduce to order the whole ruffled
head. The birds chattered on, the hand went back to its
clutching and combing; once more the wind blew;
<span class="pageno" id="Page_19">19</span>darkness came down, and the gas lamps round the square
lit up the outer leaves of the plane trees, touched the privet
bushes inside the railings with an emerald light; behind
them was impenetrable night; instead of shorn grass and
bedded geraniums there was mystery, there were endless
depths. And the birds at last were silent.</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Gumbril would get up from his iron chair, stretch
his arms and his stiff cold legs and go in through the French
window to work. The birds were his diversion; when
they were silent, it was time to think of serious matters.</p>
<p class="c010">To-night, however, he was not working; for always on
Sunday evenings his old friend Porteous came to dine and
talk. Breaking in unexpectedly at midnight, Gumbril
Junior found them sitting in front of the gas fire in his
father’s study.</p>
<p class="c010">“My dear fellow, what on earth are you doing here?”
Gumbril Senior jumped up excitedly at his son’s entrance.
The light silky hair floated up with the movement, turned
for a moment into a silver aureole, then subsided again.
Mr. Porteous stayed where he was, calm, solid and undishevelled
as a seated pillar-box. He wore a monocle on a
black ribbon, a black stock tie that revealed above its double
folds a quarter of an inch of stiff white collar, a double-breasted
black coat, a pair of pale checked trousers and
patent leather boots with cloth tops. Mr. Porteous was
very particular about his appearance. Meeting him casually
for the first time, one would not have guessed that Mr.
Porteous was an expert on Late Latin poetry; and he did
not mean that you should guess. Thin-limbed, bent and
agile in his loose, crumpled clothes, Gumbril Senior had
the air, beside Mr. Porteous, of a strangely animated
scarecrow.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_20">20</span>“What on earth?” the old gentleman repeated his question.</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril Junior shrugged his shoulders. “I was bored,
I decided to cease being a schoolmaster.” He spoke with a
fine airy assumption of carelessness. “How are you, Mr.
Porteous?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Thank you, invariably well.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Well, well,” said Gumbril Senior, sitting down again,
“I must say I’m not surprised. I’m only surprised that
you stood it, not being a born pedagogue, for as long as you
did. What ever induced you to think of turning usher,
I can’t imagine.” He looked at his son first through his
spectacles, then over the top of them; the motives of the
boy’s conduct revealed themselves to neither vision.</p>
<p class="c010">“What else was there for me to do?” asked Gumbril
Junior, pulling up a chair towards the fire. “You gave me
a pedagogue’s education and washed your hands of me.
No opportunities, no openings. I had no alternative.
And now you reproach me.”</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Gumbril made an impatient gesture. “You’re
talking nonsense,” he said. “The only point of the kind of
education you had is this, it gives a young man leisure to
find out what he’s interested in. You apparently weren’t
sufficiently interested in anything——”</p>
<p class="c010">“I am interested in everything,” interrupted Gumbril
Junior.</p>
<p class="c010">“Which comes to the same thing,” said his father parenthetically,
“as being interested in nothing.” And he went
on from the point at which he had been interrupted. “You
weren’t sufficiently interested in anything to want to devote
yourself to it. That was why you sought the last refuge
of feeble minds with classical educations, you became a
schoolmaster.”</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_21">21</span>“Come, come,” said Mr. Porteous. “I do a little teaching
myself; I must stand up for the profession.”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril Senior let go his beard and brushed back the
hair that the wind of his own vehemence had brought
tumbling into his eyes. “I don’t denigrate the profession,”
he said. “Not at all. It would be an excellent
profession if every one who went into it were as much
interested in teaching as you are in your job, Porteous, or
I in mine. It’s these undecided creatures like Theodore,
who ruin it by drifting in. Until all teachers are geniuses
and enthusiasts, nobody will learn anything, except what
they teach themselves.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Still,” said Mr. Porteous, “I wish I hadn’t had to
learn so much by myself. I wasted a lot of time finding
out how to set to work and where to discover what I
wanted.”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril Junior was lighting his pipe. “I have come to
the conclusion,” he said, speaking in little jerks between
each suck of the flame into the bowl, “that most people ...
ought never ... to be taught anything at all.”
He threw away the match. “Lord have mercy upon us,
they’re dogs. What’s the use of teaching them anything
except to behave well, to work and obey. Facts, theories,
the truth about the universe—what good are those to them?
Teach them to understand—why, it only confuses them;
makes them lose hold of the simple real appearance. Not
more than one in a hundred can get any good out of a
scientific or literary education.”</p>
<p class="c010">“And you’re one of the ones?” asked his father.</p>
<p class="c010">“That goes without saying,” Gumbril Junior replied.</p>
<p class="c010">“I think you mayn’t be so far wrong,” said Mr. Porteous.
“When I think of my own children, for example....”
<span class="pageno" id="Page_22">22</span>he sighed, “I thought they’d be interested in the things
that interested me; they don’t seem to be interested in
anything but behaving like little apes—not very anthropoid
ones either, for that matter. At my eldest boy’s age I used
to sit up most of the night reading Latin texts. He sits
up—or rather stands, reels, trots up—dancing and drinking.
Do you remember St. Bernard? ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vigilet tota nocte
luxuriosus non solum patienter</span>’ (the ascetic and the scholar
only watch patiently); ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sed et libenter, ut suam expleat
voluptatem</span>.’ What the wise man does out of a sense of
duty, the fool does for fun. And I’ve tried very hard to
make him like Latin.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Well in any case,” said Gumbril Junior, “you didn’t
try to feed him on history. That’s the real unforgivable
sin. And that’s what I’ve been doing, up till this evening—encouraging
boys of fifteen and sixteen to specialize in
history, hours and hours a week, making them read bad
writers’ generalizations about subjects on which only our
ignorance allows us to generalize; teaching them to reproduce
these generalizations in horrid little ‘Essays’
of their own; rotting their minds, in fact, with a diet of
soft vagueness; scandalous it was. If these creatures are
to be taught anything, it should be something hard and
definite. Latin—that’s excellent. Mathematics, physical
science. Let them read history for amusement, certainly.
But for Heaven’s sake don’t make it the staple of education!”
Gumbril Junior spoke with the greatest earnestness,
as though he were an inspector of schools, making a
report. It was a subject on which, at the moment, he felt
very profoundly; he felt profoundly on all subjects while he
was talking about them. “I wrote a long letter to the
Headmaster about the teaching of history this evening,”
<span class="pageno" id="Page_23">23</span>he added. “It’s most important.” He shook his head
thoughtfully, “Most important.”</p>
<p class="c010">“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hora novissima, tempora pessimma sunt, vigilemus</span>,”
said Mr. Porteous, in the words of St. Peter Damianus.</p>
<p class="c010">“Very true,” Gumbril Senior applauded. “And talking
about bad times, Theodore, what do you propose to do now,
may I ask?”</p>
<p class="c010">“I mean to begin by making some money.”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril Senior put his hands on his knees, bent forward
and laughed, “Ha, ha, ha!” He had a profound bell-like
laugh that was like the croaking of a very large and melodious
frog. “You won’t,” he said, and shook his head till the
hair fell into his eyes. “You won’t,” and he laughed again.</p>
<p class="c010">“To make money,” said Mr. Porteous, “one must be
really interested in money.”</p>
<p class="c010">“And he’s not,” said Gumbril Senior. “None of us are.”</p>
<p class="c010">“When I was still uncommonly hard up,” Mr. Porteous
continued, “we used to lodge in the same house with a
Russian Jew, who was a furrier. That man was interested
in money, if you like. It was a passion, an enthusiasm, an
ideal. He could have led a comfortable, easy life, and still
have made enough to put by something for his old age.
But for his high abstract ideal of money he suffered more
than Michelangelo ever suffered for his art. He used to
work nineteen hours a day, and the other five he slept,
lying under his bench, in the dirt, breathing into his lungs
the stink and the broken hairs. He is now very rich indeed
and does nothing with his money, doesn’t want to do
anything, doesn’t know what one does do with it. He
desires neither power nor pleasure. His desire for lucre
is purely disinterested. He reminds me of Browning’s
‘Grammarian.’ I have a great admiration for him.”</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_24">24</span>Mr. Porteous’s own passion had been for the poems of
Notker Balbulus and St. Bernard. It had taken him nearly
twenty years to get himself and his family out of the house
where the Russian furrier used to lodge. But Notker was
worth it, he used to say; Notker was worth even the
weariness and the pallor of a wife who worked beyond her
strength, even the shabbiness of ill-dressed and none too
well-fed children. He had readjusted his monocle and
gone on. But there had been occasions when it needed
more than the monocle and the careful, distinguished
clothes to keep up his <em>morale</em>. Still, those times were over
now; Notker had brought him at last a kind of fame—even,
indirectly, a certain small prosperity.</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril Senior turned once more towards his son.
“And how do you propose,” he asked, “to make this
money?”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril Junior explained. He had thought it all out
in the cab on the way from the station. “It came to me
this morning,” he said, “in chapel, during service.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Monstrous,” put in Gumbril Senior, with a genuine
indignation, “monstrous these mediæval survivals in
schools! Chapel, indeed!”</p>
<p class="c010">“It came,” Gumbril Junior went on, “like an apocalypse,
suddenly, like a divine inspiration. A grand and luminous
idea came to me—the idea of Gumbril’s Patent Small-Clothes.”</p>
<p class="c010">“And what are Gumbril’s Patent Small-Clothes?”</p>
<p class="c010">“A boon to those whose occupation is sedentary”;
Gumbril Junior had already composed his prospectus and his
first advertisements: “a comfort to all travellers, civilization’s

<p class="c012">Your small-clothes sound to me very like one of my old
litanies, Theodore.”</p>
<p class="c010">“We want scientific descriptions, not litanies,” said
Gumbril Senior. “What <em>are</em> Gumbril’s Patent Small-Clothes?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Scientifically, then,” said Gumbril Junior, “my Patent
Small-Clothes may be described as trousers with a pneumatic
seat, inflateable by means of a tube fitted with a
valve; the whole constructed of stout seamless red rubber,
enclosed between two layers of cloth.”</p>
<p class="c010">“I must say,” said Gumbril Senior on a tone of somewhat
grudging approbation, “I have heard of worse inventions.
You are too stout, Porteous, to be able to appreciate the
idea. We Gumbrils are all a bony lot.”</p>
<p class="c010">“When I have taken out a patent for my invention,” his
son went on, very business-like and cool, “I shall either sell
it to some capitalist, or I shall exploit it commercially
myself. In either case, I shall make money, which is more,
I may say, than you or any other Gumbril have ever done.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Quite right,” said Gumbril Senior, “quite right”; and
he laughed very cheerfully. “And nor will you. You
can be grateful to your intolerable Aunt Flo for having
left you that three hundred a year. You’ll need it. But
if you really want a capitalist,” he went on, “I have exactly
the man for you. He’s a man who has a mania for buying
Tudor houses and making them more Tudor than they are.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_26">26</span>I’ve pulled half a dozen of the wretched things to pieces
and put them together again differently for him.”</p>
<p class="c010">“He doesn’t sound much good to me,” said his son.</p>
<p class="c010">“Ah, but that’s only his vice. Only his amusement.
His business,” Gumbril Senior hesitated.</p>
<p class="c010">“Well, what is his business?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Well, it seems to be everything. Patent medicine,
trade newspapers, bankrupt tobacconist’s stock—he’s talked
to me about those and heaps more. He seems to flit like
a butterfly in search of honey, or rather money.”</p>
<p class="c010">“And he makes it?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Well, he pays my fees and he buys more Tudor houses,
and he gives me luncheons at the Ritz. That’s all I
know.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Well, there’s no harm in trying.”</p>
<p class="c010">“I’ll write to him,” said Gumbril Senior. “His name
is Boldero. He’ll either laugh at your idea or take it and
give you nothing for it. Still,” he looked at his son over
the top of his spectacles, “if by any conceivable chance
you ever should become rich; if, if, if....” And he
emphasized the remoteness of the conditional by raising
his eyebrows a little higher, by throwing out his hands in a
dubious gesture a little farther at every repetition of the
word, “if—why, then I’ve got exactly the thing for you.
Look at this really delightful little idea I had this afternoon.”
He put his hand in his coat pocket and after some sorting
and sifting produced a sheet of squared paper on which
was roughly drawn the elevation of a house. “For any one
with eight or ten thousand to spend, this would be—this
would be....” Gumbril Senior smoothed his hair and
hesitated, searching for something strong enough to say
of his little idea. “Well, this would be much too good for
<span class="pageno" id="Page_27">27</span>most of the greasy devils who do have eight or ten thousand
to spend.”</p>
<p class="c010">He passed the sheet to Gumbril Junior, who held it out
so that both Mr. Porteous and himself could look at it.
Gumbril Senior got up from his chair and, standing behind
them, leant over to elucidate and explain.</p>
<p class="c010">“You see the idea,” he said, anxious lest they should
fail to understand. “A central block of three stories, with
low wings of only one, ending in pavilions with a second
floor. And the flat roofs of the wings are used as gardens—you
see?—protected from the north by a wall. In the
east wing there is the kitchen and the garage, with the
maids’ rooms in the pavilion at the end. The west is a
library, and it has an arcaded loggia along the front. And
instead of a solid superstructure corresponding to the maids’
rooms, there’s a pergola with brick piers. You see? And
in the main block there’s a Spanish sort of balcony along
the whole length at first-floor level; that gives a good
horizontal line. And you get the perpendiculars with
coigns and raised panels. And the roof’s hidden by a
balustrade, and there are balustrades along the open sides
of the roof gardens on the wings. All in brick it is. This
is the garden front; the entrance front will be admirable
too. Do you like it?”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril Junior nodded. “Very much,” he said.</p>
<p class="c010">His father sighed and taking the sketch put it back in his
pocket. “You must hurry up with your ten thousand,”
he said. “And you Porteous, and you. I’ve been waiting
so long to build your splendid house.”</p>
<p class="c010">Laughing, Mr. Porteous got up from his chair. “And
long, dear Gumbril,” he said, “may you continue to wait.
For my splendid house won’t be built this side of New
<span class="pageno" id="Page_28">28</span>Jerusalem, and you must go on living a long time yet.
A long, long time,” Mr. Porteous repeated; and carefully
he buttoned up his double-breasted coat, carefully, as
though he were adjusting an instrument of precision, he
took out and replaced his monocle. Then, very erect and
neat, very soldierly and pillar-boxical, he marched towards
the door. “You’ve kept me very late to-night,” he said.
“Unconscionably late.”</p>
<p class="c010">The front door closed heavily behind Mr. Porteous’s
departure. Gumbril Senior came upstairs again into the
big room on the first floor smoothing down his hair, which
the impetuosity of his ascent had once more disarranged.</p>
<p class="c010">“That’s a good fellow,” he said of his departed guest, “a
splendid fellow.”</p>
<p class="c010">“I always admire the monocle,” said Gumbril Junior
irrelevantly. But his father turned the irrelevance into
relevance.</p>
<p class="c010">“He couldn’t have come through without it, I believe.
It was a symbol, a proud flag. Poverty’s squalid, not fine
at all. The monocle made a kind of difference, you understand.
I’m always so enormously thankful I had a little
money. I couldn’t have stuck it without. It needs
strength, more strength than I’ve got.” He clutched his
beard close under the chin and remained for a moment
pensively silent. “The advantage of Porteous’s line of
business,” he went on at last, reflectively, “is that it can
be carried on by oneself, without collaboration. There’s
no need to appeal to any one outside oneself, or to have
any dealings with other people at all, if one doesn’t want
to. That’s so deplorable about architecture. There’s no
privacy, so to speak; always this horrible jostling with
clients and builders and contractors and people, before one
<span class="pageno" id="Page_29">29</span>can get anything done. It’s really revolting. I’m not
good at people. Most of them I don’t like at all, not at
all,” Mr. Gumbril repeated with vehemence. “I don’t
deal with them very well; it isn’t my business. My business
is architecture. But I don’t often get a chance of practising
it. Not properly.”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril Senior smiled rather sadly. “Still,” he said,
“I can do something. I have my talent, I have my imagination.
They can’t take those from me. Come and see
what I’ve been doing lately.”</p>
<p class="c010">He led the way out of the room and mounted, two steps
at a time, towards a higher floor. He opened the door of
what should have been, in a well-ordered house, the Best
Bedroom, and slipped into the darkness.</p>
<p class="c010">“Don’t rush in,” he called back to his son, “for God’s
sake don’t rush in. You’ll smash something. Wait till
I’ve turned on the light. It’s so like these asinine electricians
to have hidden the switch behind the door like
this.” Gumbril Junior heard him fumbling in the darkness;
there was suddenly light. He stepped in.</p>
<p class="c010">The only furniture in the room consisted of a couple of
long trestle tables. On these, on the mantelpiece and all
over the floor, were scattered confusedly, like the elements
of a jumbled city, a vast collection of architectural models.
There were cathedrals, there were town halls, universities,
public libraries, there were three or four elegant little
sky-scrapers, there were blocks of offices, huge warehouses,
factories, and finally dozens of magnificent country mansions,
complete with their terraced gardens, their noble
flights of steps, their fountains and ornamental waters
and grandly bridged canals, their little rococo pavilions
and garden houses.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_30">30</span>“Aren’t they beautiful?” Gumbril Senior turned
enthusiastically towards his son. His long grey hair floated
wispily about his head, his spectacles flashed, and behind
them his eyes shone with emotion.</p>
<p class="c010">“Beautiful,” Gumbril Junior agreed.</p>
<p class="c010">“When you’re really rich,” said his father, “I’ll build
you one of these.” And he pointed to a little village of
Chatsworths clustering, at one end of a long table, round
the dome of a vaster and austerer St. Peter’s. “Look at
this one, for example.” He picked his way nimbly across
the room, seized the little electric reading-lamp that stood
between a railway station and a baptistery on the mantelpiece,
and was back again in an instant, trailing behind him a
long flex that, as it tautened out, twitched one of the crowning
pinnacles off the top of a sky-scraper near the fireplace.
“Look,” he repeated, “look.” He switched on the current,
and moving the lamp back and forth, up and down in front
of the miniature palace. “See the beauty of the light
and shade,” he said. “There, underneath the great,
ponderous cornice, isn’t that fine? And look how splendidly
the pilasters carry up the vertical lines. And then
the solidity of it, the size, the immense, impending bleakness
of it!” He threw up his arms, he turned his eyes
upwards as though standing overwhelmed at the foot of
some huge precipitous façade. The lights and shadows
vacillated wildly through all the city of palaces and domes
as he brandished the lamp in ecstasy above his head.</p>
<p class="c010">“And then,” he had suddenly stooped down, he was
peering and pointing once more into the details of his
palace, “then there’s the doorway—all florid and rich
with carving. How magnificently and surprisingly it
flowers out of the bare walls! Like the colossal writing of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_31">31</span>Darius, like the figures graven in the bald face of the precipice
over Behistun—unexpected and beautiful and human,
human in the surrounding emptiness.”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril Senior brushed back his hair and turned, smiling,
to look at his son over the top of his spectacles.</p>
<p class="c010">“Very fine,” Gumbril Junior nodded to him. “But
isn’t the wall a little too blank? You seem to allow very
few windows in this vast palazzo.”</p>
<p class="c010">“True,” his father replied, “very true.” He sighed.
“I’m afraid this design would hardly do for England. It’s
meant for a place where there’s some sun—where you do
your best to keep the light out, instead of letting it in,
as you have to do here. Windows are the curse of architecture
in this country. Your walls have to be like sieves,
all holes, it’s heart-breaking. If you wanted me to build
you this house, you’d have to live in Barbados or somewhere
like that.”</p>
<p class="c010">“There’s nothing I should like better,” said Gumbril
Junior.</p>
<p class="c010">“Another great advantage of sunny countries,” Gumbril
Senior pursued, “is that one can really live like an aristocrat,
in privacy, by oneself. No need to look out on the dirty
world or to let the dirty world look in on you. Here’s
this great house, for example, looking out on the world
through a few dark portholes and a single cavernous doorway.
But look inside.” He held his lamp above the
courtyard that was at the heart of the palace. Gumbril
Junior leaned and looked, like his father. “All the life
looks inwards—into a lovely courtyard, a more than Spanish
<em>patio</em>. Look there at the treble tiers of arcades, the vaulted
cloisters for your cool peripatetic meditations, the central
Triton spouting white water into a marble pool, the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_32">32</span>mosaic work on the floor and flowering up the walls,
brilliant against the white stucco. And there’s the archway
that leads out into the gardens. And now you must
come and have a look at the garden front.”</p>
<p class="c010">He walked round with his lamp to the other side of the
table. There was suddenly a crash; the wire had twitched
a cathedral from off the table. It lay on the floor in disastrous
ruin as though shattered by some appalling cataclysm.</p>
<p class="c010">“Hell and death!” said Gumbril Senior in an outburst
of Elizabethan fury. He put down the lamp and ran to
see how irreparable the disaster had been. “They’re so
horribly expensive, these models,” he explained, as he bent
over the ruins. Tenderly he picked up the pieces and
replaced them on the table. “It might have been worse,”
he said at last, brushing the dust off his hands. “Though
I’m afraid that dome will never be quite the same again.”
Picking up the lamp once more, he held it high above his
head and stood looking out, with a melancholy satisfaction,
over his creations. “And to think,” he said after a pause,
“that I’ve been spending these last days designing model
cottages for workmen at Bletchley! I’m in luck to have
got the job, of course, but really, that a civilized man
should have to do jobs like that! It’s too much. In the
old days these creatures built their own hovels, and very
nice and suitable they were too. The architects busied
themselves with architecture—which is the expression of
human dignity and greatness, which is man’s protest, not
his miserable acquiescence. You can’t do much protesting
in a model cottage at seven hundred pounds a time. A
little, no doubt, you can protest a little; you can give your
cottage decent proportions and avoid sordidness and
vulgarity. But that’s all; it’s really a negative process.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_33">33</span>You can only begin to protest positively and actively when
you abandon the petty human scale and build for giants—when
you build for the spirit and the imagination of man,
not for his little body. Model cottages, indeed!”</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Gumbril snorted with indignation. “When I think
of Alberti!” And he thought of Alberti—Alberti, the
noblest Roman of them all, the true and only Roman. For
the Romans themselves had lived their own actual lives,
sordidly and extravagantly in the middle of a vulgar empire.
Alberti and his followers in the Renaissance lived the ideal
Roman life. They put Plutarch into their architecture.
They took the detestable real Cato, the Brutus of history,
and made of them Roman heroes to walk as guides and
models before them. Before Alberti there were no true
Romans, and with Piranesi’s death the race began to wither
towards extinction.</p>
<p class="c010">“And when I think of Brunelleschi!” Gumbril Senior
went on to remember with passion the architect who had
suspended on eight thin flying ribs of marble the lightest
of all domes and the loveliest.</p>
<p class="c010">“And when of Michelangelo! The grim, enormous
apse.... And of Wren and of Palladio, when I think of
all these——” Gumbril Senior waved his arms and was
silent. He could not put into words what he felt when he
thought of them.</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril Junior looked at his watch. “Half-past
two,” he said. “Time to go to bed.”</p>
<div class="chapter">
<span class="pageno" id="Page_34">34</span>
<h2 class="c008">CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>
<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c009">“Mister Gumbril!” Surprise was mingled
with delight. “This is indeed a pleasure!”
Delight was now the prevailing emotion expressed
by the voice that advanced, as yet without a visible
source, from the dark recesses of the shop.</p>
<p class="c010">“The pleasure, Mr. Bojanus, is mine.” Gumbril closed
the shop door behind him.</p>
<p class="c010">A very small man, dressed in a frock-coat, popped out
from a canyon that opened, a mere black crevice, between
two stratified precipices of mid-season suitings, and advancing
into the open space before the door bowed with an
old-world grace, revealing a nacreous scalp thinly mantled
with long damp creepers of brown hair.</p>
<p class="c010">“And to what, may I ask, do I owe this pleasure, sir?”
Mr. Bojanus looked up archly with a sideways cock of his
head that tilted the rigid points of his waxed moustache.
The fingers of his right hand were thrust into the bosom
of his frock-coat and his toes were turned out in the dancing-master’s
First Position. “A light spring great-coat, is it?
Or a new suit? I notice,” his eye travelled professionally
up and down Gumbril’s long, thin form, “I notice that
the garments you are wearing at present, Mr. Gumbril,
look—how shall I say?—well, a trifle negleejay, as the
French would put it, a trifle negleejay.”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril looked down at himself. He resented Mr.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_35">35</span>Bojanus’s negleejay, he was pained and wounded by the
aspersion. Negleejay? And he had fancied that he
really looked rather elegant and distinguished (but, after
all, he always looked that, even in rags)—no, that he looked
positively neat, like Mr. Porteous, positively soldierly in
his black jacket and his musical comedy trousers and his
patent leather shoes. And the black felt hat—didn’t that
just add the foreign, the Southern touch which saved the
whole composition from banality? He regarded himself,
trying to see his clothes—garments, Mr. Bojanus had called
them; garments, good Lord!—through the tailor’s expert
eyes. There were sagging folds about the overloaded
pockets, there was a stain on his waistcoat, the knees of his
trousers were baggy and puckered like the bare knees of
Hélène Fourmont in Rubens’s fur-coat portrait at Vienna.
Yes, it was all horribly negleejay. He felt depressed; but
looking at Mr. Bojanus’s studied and professional correctness,
he was a little comforted. That frock-coat, for
example. It was like something in a very modern picture—such
a smooth, unwrinkled cylinder about the chest,
such a sense of pure and abstract conic-ness in the sleekly
rounded skirts! Nothing could have been less negleejay.
He was reassured.</p>
<p class="c010">“I want you,” he said at last, clearing his throat importantly,
“to make me a pair of trousers to a novel specification
of my own. It’s a new idea.” And he gave a brief
description of Gumbril’s Patent Small Clothes.</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Bojanus listened with attention.</p>
<p class="c010">“I can make them for you,” he said, when the description
was finished. “I can make them for you—if you <em>really</em>
wish, Mr. Gumbril,” he added.</p>
<p class="c010">“Thank you,” said Gumbril.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_36">36</span>“And do you intend, may I ask, Mr. Gumbril, to <em>wear</em>
these ... these garments?”</p>
<p class="c010">Guiltily, Gumbril denied himself. “Only to demonstrate
the idea, Mr. Bojanus. I am exploiting the invention
commercially, you see.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Commercially? I see, Mr. Gumbril.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Perhaps you would like a share,” suggested Gumbril.</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Bojanus shook his head. “It wouldn’t do for my
cleeantail, I fear, Mr. Gumbril. You could ’ardly expect
the Best People to wear such things.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Couldn’t you?”</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Bojanus went on shaking his head. “I know them,”
he said, “I know the Best People. Well.” And he added
with an irrelevance that was, perhaps, only apparent,
“Between ourselves, Mr. Gumbril, I am a great admirer
of Lenin....”</p>
<p class="c010">“So am I,” said Gumbril, “theoretically. But then I
have so little to lose to Lenin. I can afford to admire him.
But you, Mr. Bojanus, you, the prosperous bourgeois—oh,
purely in the economic sense of the word, Mr.
Bojanus....”</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Bojanus accepted the explanation with one of his
old-world bows.</p>
<p class="c010">“... you would be among the first to suffer if an English
Lenin were to start his activities here.”</p>
<p class="c010">“There, Mr. Gumbril, if I may be allowed to say so,
you are wrong.” Mr. Bojanus removed his hand from his
bosom and employed it to emphasize the points of his discourse.
“When the revolution comes, Mr. Gumbril—the
great and necessary revolution, as Alderman Beckford called
it—it won’t be the owning of a little money that’ll get a
man into trouble. It’ll be his class-habits, Mr. Gumbril,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_37">37</span>his class-speech, his class-education. It’ll be Shibboleth
all over again, Mr. Gumbril; mark my words. The Red
Guards will stop people in the street and ask them to say
some such word as ‘towel.’ If they call it ‘towel,’ like
you and your friends, Mr. Gumbril, why then....” Mr.
Bojanus went through the gestures of pointing a rifle and
pulling the trigger; he clicked his tongue against his teeth
to symbolize the report.... “That’ll be the end of them.
But if they say ‘tèaul,’ like the rest of us, Mr. Gumbril,
it’ll be: ‘Pass Friend and Long Live the Proletariat.’ Long
live Tèaul.”</p>
<p class="c010">“I’m afraid you may be right,” said Gumbril.</p>
<p class="c010">“I’m convinced of it,” said Mr. Bojanus. “It’s my
clients, Mr. Gumbril, it’s the Best People that the other
people resent. It’s their confidence, their ease, it’s the
habit their money and their position give them of ordering
people about, it’s the way they take their place in the world
for granted, it’s their prestige, which the other people
would like to deny, but can’t—it’s all that, Mr. Gumbril,
that’s so galling.”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril nodded. He himself had envied his securer
friends their power of ignoring the humanity of those who
were not of their class. To do that really well, one must
always have lived in a large house full of clockwork servants;
one must never have been short of money, never at a
restaurant ordered the cheaper thing instead of the more
delicious; one must never have regarded a policeman as
anything but one’s paid defender against the lower orders,
never for a moment have doubted one’s divine right to
do, within the accepted limits, exactly what one liked
without a further thought to anything or any one but oneself
and one’s own enjoyment. Gumbril had been brought
<span class="pageno" id="Page_38">38</span>up among these blessed beings; but he was not one of
them. Alas? or fortunately? He hardly knew which.</p>
<p class="c010">“And what good do you expect the revolution to do,
Mr. Bojanus?” he asked at last.</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Bojanus replaced his hand in his bosom. “None
whatever, Mr. Gumbril,” he said. “None whatever.”</p>
<p class="c010">“But Liberty,” Gumbril suggested, “equality and all
that. What about those, Mr. Bojanus?”</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Bojanus smiled up at him tolerantly and kindly, as
he might have smiled at some one who had suggested, shall
we say, that evening trousers should be turned up at the
bottom. “Liberty, Mr. Gumbril?” he said; “you don’t
suppose any serious-minded person imagines a revolution
is going to bring liberty, do you?”</p>
<p class="c010">“The people who make the revolution always seem to
ask for liberty.”</p>
<p class="c010">“But do they ever get it, Mr. Gumbril?” Mr. Bojanus
cocked his head playfully and smiled. “Look at ’istory,
Mr. Gumbril, look at ’istory. First it’s the French Revolution.
They ask for political liberty. And they gets it.
Then comes the Reform Bill, then Forty-Eight, then all the
Franchise Acts and Votes for Women—always more and
more political liberty. And what’s the result, Mr. Gumbril?
Nothing at all. Who’s freer for political liberty?
Not a soul, Mr. Gumbril. There was never a greater
swindle ’atched in the ’ole of ’istory. And when you think
’ow those poor young men like Shelley talked about it—it’s
pathetic,” said Mr. Bojanus, shaking his head, “reelly
pathetic. Political liberty’s a swindle because a man doesn’t
spend his time being political. He spends it sleeping,
eating, amusing himself a little and working—mostly
working. When they’d got all the political liberty they
<span class="pageno" id="Page_39">39</span>wanted—or found they didn’t want—they began to understand
this. And so now it’s all for the industrial revolution,
Mr. Gumbril. But bless you, that’s as big a swindle
as the other. How can there ever be liberty under any
system? No amount of profit-sharing or self-government
by the workers, no amount of hyjeenic conditions or cocoa
villages or recreation grounds can get rid of the fundamental
slavery—the necessity of working. Liberty? why,
it doesn’t exist! There’s no liberty in this world; only
gilded cages. And then, Mr. Gumbril, even suppose you
could somehow get rid of the necessity of working, suppose
a man’s time were all leisure. Would he be free then?
I say nothing of the natural slavery of eating and sleeping
and all that, Mr. Gumbril; I say nothing of that, because
that, if I may say so, would be too ’air-splitting and metaphysical.
But what I do ask you is this,” and Mr. Bojanus
wagged his forefinger almost menacingly at the sleeping
partner in this dialogue: “would a man with unlimited
leisure be free, Mr. Gumbril? I say he would not. Not
unless he ’appened to be a man like you or me, Mr. Gumbril,
a man of sense, a man of independent judgment. An
ordinary man would not be free. Because he wouldn’t
know how to occupy his leisure except in some way that
would be forced on ’im by other people. People don’t
know ’ow to entertain themselves now; they leave it to
other people to do it for them. They swallow what’s
given them. They ’ave to swallow it, whether they like
it or not. Cinemas, newspapers, magazines, gramophones,
football matches, wireless telephones—take them or leave
them, if you want to amuse youself. The ordinary man
can’t leave them. He takes; and what’s that but slavery?
And so you see, Mr. Gumbril,” Mr. Bojanus smiled with a
<span class="pageno" id="Page_40">40</span>kind of roguish triumph, “you see that even in the purely
’ypothetical case of a man with indefinite leisure, there still
would be no freedom.... And the case, as I have said, is
purely ’ypothetical; at any rate so far as concerns the sort
of people who want a revolution. And as for the sort of
people who do enjoy leisure, even now—why I think, Mr.
Gumbril, you and I know enough about the Best People
to know that freedom, except possibly sexual freedom, is
not their strongest point. And sexual freedom—what’s
that?” Mr. Bojanus dramatically inquired. “You and I,
Mr. Gumbril,” he answered confidentially, “we know.
It’s an ’orrible, ’ideous slavery. That’s what it is. Or am
I wrong, Mr. Gumbril?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Quite right, quite right, Mr. Bojanus,” Gumbril
hastened to reply.</p>
<p class="c010">“From all of which,” continued Mr. Bojanus, “it follows
that, except for a few, a very few people like you and me,
Mr. Gumbril, there’s no such thing as liberty. It’s an
’oax, Mr. Gumbril. An ’orrible plant. And if I may be
allowed to say so,” Mr. Bojanus lowered his voice, but
still spoke with emphasis, “a bloody swindle.”</p>
<p class="c010">“But in that case, Mr. Bojanus, why are you so anxious
to have a revolution?” Gumbril inquired.</p>
<p class="c010">Thoughtfully, Mr. Bojanus twisted to a finer point his
waxed moustaches. “Well,” he said at last, “it would be
a nice change. I was always one for change and a little
excitement. And then there’s the scientific interest. You
never quite know ’ow an experiment will turn out, do you,
Mr. Gumbril? I remember when I was a boy, my old
dad—a great gardener he was, a regular floriculturist, you
might say, Mr. Gumbril—he tried the experiment of
grafting a sprig of Gloire de Dijon on to a black currant
<span class="pageno" id="Page_41">41</span>bush. And, would you believe it? the roses came out
black, coal black, Mr. Gumbril. Nobody would ever have
guessed that if the thing had never been tried. And that’s
what I say about the revolution. You don’t know what’ll
come of it till you try. Black roses, blue roses—’oo knows,
Mr. Gumbril, ’oo knows?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Who indeed?” Gumbril looked at his watch.
“About those trousers ...” he added.</p>
<p class="c010">“Those garments,” corrected Mr. Bojanus. “Ah, yes.
Should we say next Tuesday?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Let us say next Tuesday.” Gumbril opened the shop
door. “Good morning, Mr. Bojanus.”</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Bojanus bowed him out, as though he had been a
prince of the blood.</p>
<p class="c010">The sun was shining and at the end of the street between
the houses the sky was blue. Gauzily the distances faded
to a soft rich indistinctness; there were veils of golden
muslin thickening down the length of every vista. On the
trees in the Hanover Square gardens the young leaves were
still so green that they seemed to be alight, green fire, and
the sooty trunks looked blacker and dirtier than ever. It
would have been a pleasant and apposite thing if a cuckoo
had started calling. But though the cuckoo was silent it
was a happy day. A day, Gumbril reflected, as he strolled
idly along, to be in love.</p>
<p class="c010">From the world of tailors Gumbril passed into that of
the artificial pearl merchants and with a still keener appreciation
of the amorous qualities of this clear spring day, he
began a leisured march along the perfumed pavements of
Bond Street. He thought with a profound satisfaction
of those sixty-three papers on the Risorgimento. How
pleasant it was to waste time! And Bond Street offered
<span class="pageno" id="Page_42">42</span>so many opportunities for wasting it agreeably. He trotted
round the Spring Exhibition at the Grosvenor and came
out, a little regretting, he had to confess, his eighteen pence
for admission. After that, he pretended that he wanted
to buy a grand piano. When he had finished practising
his favourite passages on the magnificent instrument to
which they obsequiously introduced him, he looked in for
a few moments at Sotheby’s, sniffed among the ancient
books and strolled on again, admiring the cigars, the lucid
scent-bottles, the socks, the old masters, the emerald necklaces,
everything, in fact, in all the shops he passed.</p>
<p class="c010">‘Forthcoming Exhibition of Works by Casimir Lypiatt.’
The announcement caught his eye. And so poor old
Lypiatt was on the warpath again, he reflected, as he pushed
open the doors of the Albemarle Galleries. Poor old
Lypiatt! Dear old Lypiatt, even. He liked Lypiatt.
Though he had his defects. It would be fun to see him
again.</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril found himself in the midst of a dismal collection
of etchings. He passed them in review, wondering why
it was that, in these hard days when no painter can sell a
picture, almost any dull fool who can scratch a conventional
etcher’s view of two boats, a suggested cloud and the flat
sea should be able to get rid of his prints by the dozen and
at guineas apiece. He was interrupted in his speculations
by the approach of the assistant in charge of the gallery.
He came up shyly and uncomfortably, but with the conscientious
determination of one ambitious to do his duty
and make good. He was a very young man with pale hair,
to which heavy oiling had given a curious greyish colour,
and a face of such childish contour and so imberb that he
looked like a little boy playing at grown-ups. He had
<span class="pageno" id="Page_43">43</span>only been at this job a few weeks and he found it very
difficult.</p>
<p class="c010">“This,” he remarked, with a little introductory cough,
pointing to one view of the two boats and the flat sea, “is
an earlier state than this.” And he pointed to another
view, where the boats were still two and the sea seemed
just as flat—though possibly, on a closer inspection, it might
really have been flatter.</p>
<p class="c010">“Indeed,” said Gumbril.</p>
<p class="c010">The assistant was rather pained by his coldness. He
blushed; but constrained himself to go on. “Some
excellent judges,” he said, “prefer the earlier state, though
it is less highly finished.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Ah?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Beautiful atmosphere, isn’t it?” The assistant put his
head on one side and pursed his childish lips appreciatively.</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril nodded.</p>
<p class="c010">With desperation, the assistant indicated the shadowed
rump of one of the boats. “A wonderful feeling in this
passage,” he said, redder than ever.</p>
<p class="c010">“Very intense,” said Gumbril.</p>
<p class="c010">The assistant smiled at him gratefully. “That’s the
word,” he said, delighted. “Intense. That’s it. Very
intense.” He repeated the word several times as though
to make sure of remembering it when the occasion next
presented itself. He was determined to make good.</p>
<p class="c010">“I see Mr. Lypiatt is to have a show here soon,” remarked
Gumbril, who had had enough of the boats.</p>
<p class="c010">“He is making the final arrangements with Mr. Albemarle
at this very moment,” said the assistant triumphantly, with
the air of one who produces, at the dramatic and critical
moment, a rabbit out of the empty hat.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_44">44</span>“You don’t say so?” Gumbril was duly impressed.
“Then I’ll wait till he comes out,” he said, and sat down
with his back to the boats.</p>
<p class="c010">The assistant returned to his desk and picked up the gold-belted
fountain pen which his Aunt had given him when
he first went into business, last Christmas. “Very intense,”
he wrote in capitals on a half-sheet of notepaper. “The
feeling in this passage is very intense.” He studied the
paper for a few moments, then folded it up carefully and
put it away in his waistcoat pocket. “Always make a
note of it.” That was one of the business mottoes he had
himself written out so laboriously in Indian ink and old
English lettering. It hung over his bed between “The
Lord is my Shepherd,” which his mother had given him,
and a quotation from Dr. Frank Crane, “A smiling face
sells more goods than a clever tongue.” Still, a clever
tongue, the young assistant had often reflected, was a very
useful thing, especially in this job. He wondered whether
one could say that the composition of a picture was very
intense. Mr. Albemarle was very keen on the composition,
he noticed. But perhaps it was better to stick to plain
‘fine,’ which was a little commonplace, perhaps, but very
safe. He would ask Mr. Albemarle about it. And then
there was all that stuff about plastic values and pure
plasticity. He sighed. It was all very difficult. A chap
might be as willing and eager to make good as he liked; but
when it came to this about atmosphere and intense passages
and plasticity—well, really, what could a chap do? Make
a note of it. It was the only thing.</p>
<p class="c010">In Mr. Albemarle’s private room Casimir Lypiatt
thumped the table. “Size, Mr. Albemarle,” he was
saying, “size and vehemence and spiritual significance—that’s
<span class="pageno" id="Page_45">45</span>what the old fellows had, and we haven’t....”
He gesticulated as he talked, his face worked and his green
eyes, set in their dark, charred orbits, were full of a troubled
light. The forehead was precipitous, the nose long and
sharp; in the bony and almost fleshless face, the lips of the
wide mouth were surprisingly full.</p>
<p class="c010">“Precisely, precisely,” said Mr. Albemarle in his juicy
voice. He was a round, smooth, little man with a head
like an egg; he spoke, he moved with a certain pomp,
a butlerish gravity, that were evidently meant to be ducal.</p>
<p class="c010">“That’s what I’ve set myself to recapture,” Lypiatt
went on: “the size, the masterfulness of the masters.”
He felt a warmth running through him as he spoke, flushing
his cheeks, pulsing hotly behind the eyes, as though he had
drunk a draught of some heartening red wine. His own
words elated him, and drunkenly gesticulating, he was as
though drunken. The greatness of the masters—he felt
it in him. He knew his own power, he knew, he knew. He
could do all that they had done. Nothing was beyond
his strength.</p>
<p class="c010">Egg-headed Albemarle confronted him, impeccably the
butler, exacerbatingly serene. Albemarle too should be
fired. He struck the table once more, he broke out
again:</p>
<p class="c010">“It’s been my mission,” he shouted, “all these years.”</p>
<p class="c010">All these years.... Time had worn the hair from his
temples; the high, steep forehead seemed higher than it
really was. He was forty now; the turbulent young Lypiatt
who had once declared that no man could do anything
worth doing after he was thirty, was forty now. But in
these fiery moments he could forget the years, he could forget
the disappointments, the unsold pictures, the bad reviews.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_46">46</span>“My mission,” he repeated; “and by God! I feel, I
know I can carry it through.”</p>
<p class="c010">Warmly the blood pulsed behind his eyes.</p>
<p class="c010">“Quite,” said Mr. Albemarle, nodding the egg. “Quite.”</p>
<p class="c010">“And how small the scale is nowadays!” Lypiatt went
on, rhapsodically. “How trivial the conception, how
limited the scope! You see no painter-sculptor-poets,
like Michelangelo; no scientist-artists, like Leonardo;
no mathematician-courtiers, like Boscovitch; no impresario-musicians,
like Handel; no geniuses of all trades,
like Wren. I have set myself against this abject specialization
of ours. I stand alone, opposing it with my example.”
Lypiatt raised his hand. Like the statue of Liberty,
standing colossal and alone.</p>
<p class="c010">“Nevertheless,” began Mr. Albemarle.</p>
<p class="c010">“Painter, poet, musician,” cried Lypiatt. “I am all
three. I....”</p>
<p class="c010">“... there is a danger of—how shall I put it—dissipating
one’s energies,” Mr. Albemarle went on with determination.
Discreetly, he looked at his watch. This
conversation, he thought, seemed to be prolonging itself
unnecessarily.</p>
<p class="c010">“There is a greater danger in letting them stagnate
and atrophy,” Lypiatt retorted. “Let me give you my
experience.” Vehemently, he gave it.</p>
<p class="c010">Out in the gallery, among the boats, the views of the
Grand Canal, and the Firth of Forth, Gumbril placidly
ruminated. Poor old Lypiatt, he was thinking. Dear old
Lypiatt, even, in spite of his fantastic egotism. Such a
bad painter, such a bombinating poet, such a loud emotional
improviser on the piano! And going on like this, year
after year, pegging away at the same old things—always
<span class="pageno" id="Page_47">47</span>badly! And always without a penny, always living in the
most hideous squalor! Magnificent and pathetic old
Lypiatt!</p>
<p class="c010">A door suddenly opened and a loud, unsteady voice, now
deep and harsh, now breaking to shrillness, exploded into
the gallery.</p>
<p class="c010">“... like a Veronese,” it was saying; “enormous,
vehement, a great swirling composition” (‘swirling composition’—mentally,
the young assistant made a note of
that), “but much more serious, of course, much more
spiritually significant, much more——”</p>
<p class="c010">“Lypiatt!” Gumbril had risen from his chair, had
turned, had advanced, holding out his hand.</p>
<p class="c010">“Why, it’s Gumbril. Good Lord!” and Lypiatt seized
the proffered hand with an excruciating cordiality. He
seemed to be in exuberantly good spirits. “We’re settling
about my show, Mr. Albemarle and I,” he explained.
“You know Gumbril, Mr. Albemarle?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Pleased to meet you,” said Mr. Albemarle. “Our
friend, Mr. Lypiatt,” he added richly, “has the true
artistic temp——”</p>
<p class="c010">“It’s going to be magnificent.” Lypiatt could not
wait till Mr. Albemarle had finished speaking. He gave
Gumbril a heroic blow on the shoulder.</p>
<p class="c010">“... artistic temperament, as I was saying,” pursued
Mr. Albemarle. “He is altogether too impatient and
enthusiastic for us poor people ...” a ducal smile of condescension
accompanied this graceful act of self-abasement ...
“who move in the prosaic, practical, workaday
world.”</p>
<p class="c010">Lypiatt laughed, a loud, discordant peal. He didn’t
seem to mind being accused of having an artistic temperament;
<span class="pageno" id="Page_48">48</span>he seemed, indeed, to enjoy it, if anything. “Fire
and water,” he said aphoristically, “brought together, beget
steam. Mr. Albemarle and I go driving along like a steam
engine. Psh, psh!” He worked his arms like a pair of
alternate pistons. He laughed; but Mr. Albemarle only
coldly and courteously smiled. “I was just telling Mr.
Albemarle about the great Crucifixion I’ve just been doing.
It’s as big and headlong as a Veronese, but much more
serious, more....”</p>
<p class="c010">Behind them the little assistant was expounding to a new
visitor the beauties of the etchings. “Very intense,” he
was saying, “the feeling in this passage.” The shadow,
indeed, clung with an insistent affection round the stern
of the boat. “And what a fine, what a——” he hesitated
for an instant, and under his pale, oiled hair his face became
suddenly very red—“what a swirling composition.” He
looked anxiously at the visitor. The remark had been
received without comment. He felt immensely relieved.</p>
<p class="c010">They left the galleries together. Lypiatt set the pace,
striding along at a great rate and with a magnificent brutality
through the elegant and leisured crowd, gesticulating and
loudly talking as he went. He carried his hat in his hand;
his tie was brilliantly orange. People turned to look at
him as he passed and he liked it. He had, indeed, a remarkable
face—a face that ought by rights to have belonged to
a man of genius. Lypiatt was aware of it. The man of
genius, he liked to say, bears upon his brow a kind of mark
of Cain, by which men recognize him at once—“and having
recognized, generally stone him,” he would add with that
peculiar laugh he always uttered whenever he said anything
rather bitter or cynical; a laugh that was meant to show
that the bitterness, the cynicism, justifiable as events might
<span class="pageno" id="Page_49">49</span>have made them, were really only a mask, and that beneath
it the artist was still serenely and tragically smiling. Lypiatt
thought a great deal about the ideal artist. That titanic
abstraction stalked within his own skin. He was it—a
little too consciously, perhaps.</p>
<p class="c010">“This time,” he kept repeating, “they’ll be bowled over.
This time.... It’s going to be terrific.” And with the
blood beating behind his eyes, with the exultant consciousness
and certainty of power growing and growing in him
with every word he spoke, Lypiatt began to describe the
pictures there would be at his show; he talked about the
preface he was writing to the catalogue, the poems that
would be printed in it by way of literary complement to
the pictures. He talked, he talked.</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril listened, not very attentively. He was wondering
how any one could talk so loud, could boast so extravagantly.
It was as though the man had to shout in order
to convince himself of his own existence. Poor Lypiatt;
after all these years, Gumbril supposed, he must have some
doubts about it. Ah, but this time, this time he was going
to bowl them all over.</p>
<p class="c010">“You’re pleased, then, with what you’ve done recently,”
he said at the end of one of Lypiatt’s long tirades.</p>
<p class="c010">“Pleased?” exclaimed Lypiatt; “I should think I was.”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril might have reminded him that he had been as
well pleased in the past and that ‘they’ had by no means
been bowled over. He preferred, however, to say nothing.
Lypiatt went on about the size and universality of the old
masters. He himself, it was tacitly understood, was one
of them.</p>
<p class="c010">They parted near the bottom of the Tottenham Court
Road, Lypiatt to go northward to his studio off Maple
<span class="pageno" id="Page_50">50</span>Street, Gumbril to pay one of his secret visits to those
rooms of his in Great Russell Street. He had taken them
nearly a year ago now, two little rooms over a grocer’s shop,
promising himself goodness only knew what adventures in
them. But somehow there had been no adventures. Still,
it had pleased him, all the same, to be able to go there from
time to time when he was in London and to think, as he
sat in solitude before his gas fire, that there was literally
not a soul in the universe who knew where he was. He
had an almost childish affection for mysteries and secrets.</p>
<p class="c010">“Good-bye,” said Gumbril, raising his hand to the
salute. “And I’ll beat up some people for dinner on
Friday.” (For they had agreed to meet again.) He turned
away, thinking that he had spoken the last words; but he
was mistaken.</p>
<p class="c010">“Oh, by the way,” said Lypiatt, who had also turned to
go, but who now came stepping quickly after his companion.
“Can you, by any chance, lend me five pounds. Only till
after the exhibition, you know. I’m a bit short.”</p>
<p class="c010">Poor old Lypiatt! But it was with reluctance that
Gumbril parted from his Treasury notes.</p>
<div class="chapter">
<span class="pageno" id="Page_51">51</span>
<h2 class="c008">CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>
<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c009">Lypiatt had a habit, which some of his friends found
rather trying—and not only friends, for Lypiatt
was ready to let the merest acquaintances, the
most absolute strangers, even, into the secrets of his inspiration—a
habit of reciting at every possible opportunity his
own verses. He would declaim in a voice loud and tremulous,
with an emotion that never seemed to vary with the
varying subject-matter of his poems, for whole quarters
of an hour at a stretch; would go on declaiming till his
auditors were overwhelmed with such a confusion of embarrassment
and shame, that the blood rushed to their cheeks
and they dared not meet one another’s eyes.</p>
<p class="c010">He was declaiming now; not merely across the dinner
table to his own friends, but to the whole restaurant. For
at the first reverberating lines of his latest, “The Conquistador,”
there had been a startled turning of heads, a
craning of necks from every corner of the room. The
people who came to this Soho restaurant because it was,
notoriously, so ‘artistic,’ looked at one another significantly
and nodded; they were getting their money’s worth, this
time. And Lypiatt, with a fine air of rapt unconsciousness,
went on with his recitation.</p>
<p class="c010">“Look down on Mexico, Conquistador”—that was the
refrain.</p>
<p class="c010">The Conquistador, Lypiatt had made it clear, was the
Artist, and the Vale of Mexico on which he looked down,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_52">52</span>the towered cities of Tlacopan and Chalco, of Tenochtitlan
and Iztapalapan symbolized—well, it was difficult to say
precisely what. The universe, perhaps?</p>
<p class="c010">“Look down,” cried Lypiatt, with a quivering voice.</p>
<div class="lg-container-b c011">
<div class="linegroup">
<div class="group">
<div class="line">“Look down, Conquistador!</div>
<div class="line">There on the valley’s broad green floor,</div>
<div class="line">There lies the lake; the jewelled cities gleam;</div>
<div class="line">Chalco and Tlacopan</div>
<div class="line">Awaiting the coming Man.</div>
<div class="line">Look down on Mexico, Conquistador,</div>
<div class="line">Land of your golden dream.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="c010">“Not ‘dream,’” said Gumbril, putting down the glass
from which he had been profoundly drinking. “You can’t
possibly say ‘dream,’ you know.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Why do you interrupt me?” Lypiatt turned on him
angrily. His wide mouth twitched at the corners, his whole
long face worked with excitement. “Why don’t you let
me finish?” He allowed his hand, which had hung
awkwardly in the air above him, suspended, as it were,
at the top of a gesture, to sink slowly to the table. “Imbecile!”
he said, and once more picked up his knife and
fork.</p>
<p class="c010">“But really,” Gumbril insisted, “you can’t say ‘dream.’
Can you now, seriously?” He had drunk the best part of a
bottle of Burgundy and he felt good-humoured, obstinate
and a little bellicose.</p>
<p class="c010">“And why not?” Lypiatt asked.</p>
<p class="c010">“Oh, because one simply can’t.” Gumbril leaned back
in his chair, smiled and caressed his drooping blond moustache.
“Not in this year of grace, nineteen twenty-two.”</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_53">53</span>“But why?” Lypiatt repeated, with exasperation.</p>
<p class="c010">“Because it’s altogether <em>too</em> late in the day,” declared
precious Mr. Mercaptan, rushing up to his emphasis with
flutes and roaring, like a true Conquistador, to fall back,
however, at the end of the sentence rather ignominiously
into a breathless confusion. He was a sleek, comfortable
young man with smooth brown hair parted in the centre
and conducted in a pair of flowing curves across the temples,
to be looped in damp curls behind his ears. His face ought
to have been rather more exquisite, rather more refinedly
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dix-huitième</span></i> than it actually was. It had a rather gross,
snouty look, which was sadly out of harmony with Mr.
Mercaptan’s inimitably graceful style. For Mr. Mercaptan
had a style and used it, delightfully, in his middle articles
for the literary weeklies. His most precious work, however,
was that little volume of essays, prose poems, vignettes and
paradoxes, in which he had so brilliantly illustrated his
favourite theme—the pettiness, the simian limitations, the
insignificance and the absurd pretentiousness of <em>Homo</em>
soi-disant <em>Sapiens</em>. Those who met Mr. Mercaptan personally
often came away with the feeling that perhaps,
after all, he was right in judging so severely of humanity.</p>
<p class="c010">“<em>Too</em> late in the day,” he repeated. “Times have
changed. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sunt lacrymæ rerum, nos et mutamur in illis.</span></i>”
He laughed his own applause.</p>
<p class="c010">“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quot homines, tot disputandum est</span></i>,” said Gumbril, taking
another sip of his Beaune Supérieure. At the moment,
he was all for Mercaptan.</p>
<p class="c010">“But <em>why</em> is it too late?” Lypiatt insisted.</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Mercaptan made a delicate gesture. “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ça se sent,
mon cher ami</span></i>,” he said, “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ça ne s’explique pas.</span></i>” Satan,
it is said, carries hell in his heart; so it was with Mr.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_54">54</span>Mercaptan—wherever he was, it was Paris. “Dreams in
nineteen twenty-two....” He shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p class="c010">“After you’ve accepted the war, swallowed the Russian
famine,” said Gumbril. “Dreams!”</p>
<p class="c010">“They belonged to the <em>Rostand</em> epoch,” said Mr. Mercaptan,
with a little titter. “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Rève</span></i>—ah!”</p>
<p class="c010">Lypiatt dropped his knife and fork with a clatter and
leaned forward, eager for battle. “Now I have you,” he
said, “now I have you on the hip. You’ve given yourselves
away. You’ve given away the secret of your spiritual
poverty, your weakness and pettiness and impotence....”</p>
<p class="c010">“Impotence? You malign me, sir,” said Gumbril.</p>
<p class="c010">Shearwater ponderously stirred. He had been silent
all this time, sitting with hunched shoulders, his elbows
on the table, his big round head bent forward, absorbed,
apparently, in the slow meticulous crumbling of a piece of
bread. Sometimes he put a piece of crust in his mouth and
under the bushy brown moustache his jaw moved slowly,
ruminatively, with a sideways motion, like a cow’s. He
nudged Gumbril with his elbow. “Ass,” he said, “be quiet.”</p>
<p class="c010">Lypiatt went on torrentially. “You’re afraid of ideals,
that’s what it is. You daren’t admit to having dreams.
Oh, I call them dreams,” he added parenthetically. “I
don’t mind being thought a fool and old-fashioned. The
word’s shorter and more English. Besides, it rhymes with
gleams. Ha, ha!” And Lypiatt laughed his loud Titan’s
laugh, the laugh of cynicism which seems to belie, but
which, for those who have understanding, reveals the high,
positive spirit within. “Ideals—they’re not sufficiently
genteel for you civilized young men. You’ve quite outgrown
that sort of thing. No dream, no religion, no
morality.”</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_55">55</span>“I glory in the name of earwig,” said Gumbril. He
was pleased with that little invention. It was felicitous;
it was well chosen. “One’s an earwig in sheer self-protection,”
he explained.</p>
<p class="c010">But Mr. Mercaptan refused to accept the name of earwig
at any price. “<em>What</em> there is to be ashamed of in being
civilized, I <em>really</em> don’t know,” he said, in a voice that was
now the bull’s, now the piping robin’s. “No, if I glory
in anything, it’s in my little rococo boudoir, and the conversations
across the polished mahogany, and the delicate,
lascivious, <em>witty</em> little flirtations on ample sofas inhabited
by the soul of Crebillon Fils. We needn’t <em>all</em> be Russians,
I hope. These revolting Dostoievskys.” Mr. Mercaptan
spoke with a profound feeling. “Nor all Utopians. Homo
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au naturel</span></i>——” Mr. Mercaptan applied his thumb and
forefinger to his, alas! too snout-like nose, “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ça pue</span></i>. And as
for Homo à la H. G. Wells—<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ça ne pue pas assez</span></i>. What I
glory in is the civilized, middle way between stink and
asepsis. Give me a little musk, a little intoxicating feminine
exhalation, the bouquet of old wine and strawberries, a
lavender bag under every pillow and pot-pourri in the
corners of the drawing-room. Readable books, amusing
conversation, civilized women, graceful art and dry vintage,
music, with a quiet life and reasonable comfort—that’s
<em>all</em> I ask for.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Talking about comfort,” Gumbril put in, before
Lypiatt had time to fling his answering thunders, “I must
tell you about my new invention. Pneumatic trousers,”
he explained. “Blow them up. Perfect comfort. You
see the idea? You’re a sedentary man, Mercaptan. Let
me put you down for a couple of pairs.”</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Mercaptan shook his head. “Too Wellsian,” he
<span class="pageno" id="Page_56">56</span>said. “Too horribly Utopian. They’d be ludicrously out
of place in my boudoir. And besides, my sofa is well
enough sprung already, thank you.”</p>
<p class="c010">“But what about Tolstoy?” shouted Lypiatt, letting
out his impatience in a violent blast.</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Mercaptan waved his hand. “Russian,” he said,
“Russian.”</p>
<p class="c010">“And Michelangelo?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Alberti,” said Gumbril, very seriously, giving them all
a piece of his father’s mind—“Alberti was much the better
architect, I assure you.”</p>
<p class="c010">“And pretentiousness for pretentiousness,” said Mr.
Mercaptan, “I prefer old Borromini and the baroque.”</p>
<p class="c010">“What about Beethoven?” went on Lypiatt. “What
about Blake? Where do they come in under your scheme
of things?”</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Mercaptan shrugged his shoulders. “They stay in
the hall,” he said. “I don’t let them into the boudoir.”</p>
<p class="c010">“You disgust me,” said Lypiatt, with rising indignation,
and making wider gestures. “You disgust me—you and
your odious little sham eighteenth-century civilization;
your piddling little poetry; your art for art’s sake instead
of for God’s sake; your nauseating little copulations without
love or passion; your hoggish materialism; your bestial
indifference to all that’s unhappy and your yelping hatred
of all that’s great.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Charming, charming,” murmured Mr. Mercaptan,
who was pouring oil on his salad.</p>
<p class="c010">“How can you ever hope to achieve anything decent or
solid, when you don’t even believe in decency or solidity?
I look about me,” and Lypiatt cast his eyes wildly round
the crowded room, “and I find myself alone, spiritually
<span class="pageno" id="Page_57">57</span>alone. I strive on by myself, by myself.” He struck his
breast, a giant, a solitary giant. “I have set myself to
restore painting and poetry to their rightful position among
the great moral forces. They have been amusements, they
have been mere games for too long. I am giving my life
for that. My life.” His voice trembled a little. “People
mock me, hate me, stone me, deride me. But I go on, I
go on. For I know I’m right. And in the end they too
will recognize that I’ve been right.” It was a loud soliloquy.
One could fancy that Lypiatt had been engaged in recognizing
himself.</p>
<p class="c010">“All the same,” said Gumbril with a cheerful stubbornness,
“I persist that the word ‘dreams’ is inadmissible.”</p>
<p class="c010">“<em>Inadmissible</em>,” repeated Mr. Mercaptan, imparting to
the word an additional significance by giving it its French
pronunciation. “In the age of Rostand, well and good.
But now....”</p>
<p class="c010">“Now,” said Gumbril, “the word merely connotes
Freud.”</p>
<p class="c010">“It’s a matter of literary tact,” explained Mr. Mercaptan.
“Have you no literary tact?”</p>
<p class="c010">“No,” said Lypiatt, with emphasis, “thank God, I
haven’t. I have no tact of any kind. I do things straightforwardly,
frankly, as the spirit moves me. I don’t like
compromises.”</p>
<p class="c010">He struck the table. The gesture startlingly let loose
a peal of cracked and diabolic laughter. Gumbril and
Lypiatt and Mr. Mercaptan looked quickly up; even
Shearwater lifted his great spherical head and turned towards
the sound the large disk of his face. A young man with a
blond, fan-shaped beard stood by the table, looking down
at them through a pair of bright blue eyes and smiling
<span class="pageno" id="Page_58">58</span>equivocally and disquietingly as though his mind were full
of some nameless and fantastic malice.</p>
<p class="c010">“<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Come sta la Sua Terribiltà?</span></i>” he asked; and, taking off
his preposterous bowler hat, he bowed profoundly to
Lypiatt. “How I recognize my Buonarotti!” he added
affectionately.</p>
<p class="c010">Lypiatt laughed, rather uncomfortably, and no longer on
the Titanic scale. “How I recognize my Coleman!” he
echoed, rather feebly.</p>
<p class="c010">“On the contrary,” Gumbril corrected, “how almost
completely I fail to recognize. This beard”—he pointed
to the blond fan—“why, may I ask?”</p>
<p class="c010">“More Russianism,” said Mr. Mercaptan, and shook his
head.</p>
<p class="c010">“Ah, why indeed?” Coleman lowered his voice to a
confidential whisper. “For religious reasons,” he said,
and made the sign of the cross.</p>
<div class="lg-container-b c011">
<div class="linegroup">
<div class="group">
<div class="line">“Christlike in my behaviour,</div>
<div class="line">Like every good believer,</div>
<div class="line">I imitate the Saviour,</div>
<div class="line">And cultivate a beaver.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="c012">There be beavers which have made themselves beavers
for the kingdom of heaven’s sake. But there are some
beavers, on the other hand, which were so born from their
mother’s womb.” He burst into a fit of outrageous laughter
which stopped as suddenly and as voluntarily as it had
begun.</p>
<p class="c010">Lypiatt shook his head. “Hideous,” he said, “hideous.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Moreover,” Coleman went on, without paying any
attention, “I have other and, alas! less holy reasons for
this change of face. It enables one to make such delightful
<span class="pageno" id="Page_59">59</span>acquaintances in the street. You hear some one saying,
‘Beaver,’ as you pass, and you immediately have the right
to rush up and get into conversation. I owe to this dear
symbol,” and he caressed the golden beard tenderly with
the palm of his hand, “the most admirably dangerous
relations.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Magnificent,” said Gumbril, drinking his own health.
“I shall stop shaving at once.”</p>
<p class="c010">Shearwater looked round the table with raised eyebrows
and a wrinkled forehead. “This conversation is rather
beyond me,” he said gravely. Under the formidable
moustache, under the thick, tufted eyebrows, the mouth
was small and ingenuous, the mild grey eyes full of an almost
childish inquiry. “What does the word ‘beaver’ signify
in this context? You don’t refer, I suppose, to the rodent,
<em>Castor fiber</em>?”</p>
<p class="c010">“But this is a very great man,” said Coleman, raising his
bowler. “Tell me who he is?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Our friend Shearwater,” said Gumbril, “the physiologist.”</p>
<p class="c010">Coleman bowed. “Physiological Shearwater,” he said.
“Accept my homage. To one who doesn’t know what a
beaver is, I resign all my claims to superiority. There’s
nothing else but beavers in all the papers. Tell me, do
you never read the <cite>Daily Express</cite>?”</p>
<p class="c010">“No.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Nor the <cite>Daily Mail</cite>?”</p>
<p class="c010">Shearwater shook his head.</p>
<p class="c010">“Nor the <cite>Mirror</cite>? nor the <cite>Sketch</cite>? nor the <cite>Graphic</cite>?
nor even (for I was forgetting that physiologists must
surely have Liberal opinions)—even the <cite>Daily News</cite>?”</p>
<p class="c010">Shearwater continued to shake his large spherical head.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_60">60</span>“Nor any of the evening papers?”</p>
<p class="c010">“No.”</p>
<p class="c010">Coleman once more lifted his hat. “O eloquent, just
and mighty Death!” he exclaimed, and replaced it on his
head. “You never read any papers at all—not even our
friend Mercaptan’s delicious little middles in the weeklies?
How is your delicious little middle, by the way?” Coleman
turned to Mr. Mercaptan and with the point of his huge
stick gave him a little prod in the stomach. “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ça marche—les
tripes</span></i>? Hein?” He turned back to Shearwater.
“Not even those?” he asked.</p>
<p class="c010">“Never,” said Shearwater. “I have more serious
things to think about than newspapers.”</p>
<p class="c010">“And what serious thing, may I ask?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Well, at the present moment,” said Shearwater, “I am
chiefly preoccupied with the kidneys.”</p>
<p class="c010">“The kidneys!” In an ecstasy of delight, Coleman
thumped the floor with the ferrule of his stick. “The
kidneys! Tell me all about kidneys. This is of the first
importance. This is really life. And I shall sit down at
your table without asking permission of Buonarotti here,
and in the teeth of Mercaptan, and without so much as
thinking about this species of Gumbril, who might as well
not be there at all. I shall sit down and——”</p>
<p class="c010">“Talking of sitting,” said Gumbril, “I wish I could
persuade you to order a pair of my patent pneumatic
trousers. They will——”</p>
<p class="c010">Coleman waved him away. “Not now, not now,” he
said. “I shall sit down and listen to the physiologue
talking about runions, while I myself actually eat them—<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sautés</span></i>.
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sautés</span></i>, mark my words.”</p>
<p class="c010">Laying his hat and stick on the floor beside him, he sat
<span class="pageno" id="Page_61">61</span>down at the end of the table, between Lypiatt and Shearwater.</p>
<p class="c010">“Two believers,” he said, laying his hand for a moment
on Lypiatt’s arm, “and three black-hearted unbelievers—confronted.
Eh, Buonarotti? You and I are both
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">croyants et pratiquants</span></i>, as Mercaptan would say. I believe
in one devil, father quasi-almighty, Samael and his wife,
the Woman of Whoredom. Ha, ha!” He laughed his
ferocious, artificial laugh.</p>
<p class="c010">“Here’s an end to any civilized conversation,” Mr. Mercaptan
complained, hissing on the <em>c</em>, labiating lingeringly
on the <em>v</em> of ‘civilized’ and giving the first two <em>i</em>’s their
fullest value. The word, in his mouth, seemed to take on a
special and a richer significance.</p>
<p class="c010">Coleman ignored him. “Tell me, you physiologue,”
he went on, “tell me about the physiology of the Archetypal
Man. This is most important; Buonarotti shares
my opinion about this, I know. Has the Archetypal Man
a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boyau rectum</span></i>, as Mercaptan would say again, or not?
Everything depends on this, as Voltaire realized ages ago.
‘His feet,’ as we know already on inspired authority, ‘were
straight feet; and the sole of his feet were like the sole
of a calf’s foot.’ But the viscera, you must tell us something
about the viscera. Mustn’t he, Buonarotti? And
where are my <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rognons sautés</span></i>?” he shouted at the waiter.</p>
<p class="c010">“You revolt me,” said Lypiatt.</p>
<p class="c010">“Not mortually, I ’ope?” Coleman turned with solicitude
to his neighbour; then shook his head. “Mortually
I fear. Kiss me ’Ardy, and I die happy.” He blew a kiss
into the air. “But why is the physiologue so slow? Up,
pachyderm, up! Answer. You hold the key to everything.
The key, I tell you, the key. I remember, when
<span class="pageno" id="Page_62">62</span>I used to hang about the biological laboratories at school,
eviscerating frogs—crucified with pins, they were, belly
upwards, like little green Christs—I remember once, when
I was sitting there, quietly poring over the entrails, in
came the laboratory boy and said to the stinks usher:
‘Please, sir, may I have the key of the Absolute?’ And,
would you believe it, that usher calmly put his hand in his
trouser pocket and fished out a small Yale key and gave it
him without a word. What a gesture! The key of the
Absolute. But it was only the absolute alcohol the urchin
wanted—to pickle some loathsome fœtus in, I suppose. God
rot his soul in peace! And now, Castor Fiber, out with
your key. Tell us about the Archetypal Man, tell us about
the primordial Adam. Tell us all about the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boyau rectum</span></i>.”</p>
<p class="c010">Ponderously, Shearwater moved his clumsy frame;
leaning back in his chair he scrutinized Coleman with a
large, benevolent curiosity. The eyes under the savage
eyebrows were mild and gentle; behind the fearful disguise
of the moustache he smiled poutingly, like a baby who sees
the approaching bottle. The broad, domed forehead was
serene. He ran his hand through his thick brown hair,
scratched his head meditatively and then, when he had
thoroughly examined, had comprehended and duly classified
the strange phenomenon of Coleman, opened his mouth
and uttered a little good-natured laugh of amusement.</p>
<p class="c010">“Voltaire’s question,” he said at last, in his slow, deep
voice, “seemed at the time he asked it an unanswerable
piece of irony. It would have seemed almost equally
ironic to his contemporaries, if he had asked whether God
had a pair of kidneys. We know a little more about the
kidneys nowadays. If he had asked me, I should answer:
why not? The kidneys are so beautifully organized;
<span class="pageno" id="Page_63">63</span>they do their work of regulation with such a miraculous—it’s
hard to find another word—such a positively divine
precision, such knowledge and wisdom, that there’s no
reason why your archetypal man, whoever he is, or any one
else, for that matter, should be ashamed of owning a pair.”</p>
<p class="c010">Coleman clapped his hands. “The key,” he cried, “the
key. Out of the trouser pocket of babes and sucklings it
comes. The genuine, the unique Yale. How right I was
to come here to-night! But, holy Sephiroth, there’s my
trollop.”</p>
<p class="c010">He picked up his stick, jumped from his chair and
threaded his way between the tables. A woman was
standing near the door. Coleman came up to her, pointed
without speaking to the table, and returned, driving her
along in front of him, tapping her gently over the haunches
with his stick, as one might drive a docile animal to the
slaughter.</p>
<p class="c010">“Allow me to introduce,” said Coleman. “The sharer
of my joys and sorrows. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La compagne de mes nuits blanches
et de mes jours plutÃ´t sales.</span></i> In a word, Zoe. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Qui ne comprend
pas le français, qui me déteste avec une passion égale
Ã  la mienne, et qui mangera, ma foi, des rognons pour faire
honneur au physiologue.</span></i>”</p>
<p class="c010">“Have some Burgundy?” Gumbril proffered the
bottle.</p>
<p class="c010">Zoe nodded and pushed forward her glass. She was
dark-haired, had a pale skin and eyes like round blackberries.
Her mouth was small and floridly curved. She was dressed,
rather depressingly, like a picture by Augustus John, in
blue and orange. Her expression was sullen and ferocious,
and she looked about her with an air of profound contempt.</p>
<p class="c010">“Shearwater’s no better than a mystic,” fluted Mr.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_64">64</span>Mercaptan. “A mystical scientist; really, one hadn’t
reckoned on that.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Like a Liberal Pope,” said Gumbril.  “Poor Metternich,
you remember? <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pio Nono.</span>” And he burst into a
fit of esoteric laughter. “Of less than average intelligence,”
he murmured delightedly, and refilled his glass.</p>
<p class="c010">“It’s only the deliberately blind who wouldn’t reckon
on the combination,” Lypiatt put in, indignantly. “What
are science and art, what are religion and philosophy but
so many expressions in human terms of some reality more
than human? Newton and Boehme and Michelangelo—what
are they doing but expressing, in different ways,
different aspects of the same thing?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Alberti, I beg you,” said Gumbril. “I assure you he
was the better architect.”</p>
<p class="c010">“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fi donc!</span></i>” said Mr. Mercaptan. “San Carlo alle
Quatro Fontane——” But he got no further. Lypiatt
abolished him with a gesture.</p>
<p class="c010">“One reality,” he cried, “there is only one reality.”</p>
<p class="c010">“One reality,” Coleman reached out a hand across the
table and caressed Zoe’s bare white arm, “and that is
callipygous.” Zoe jabbed at his hand with her fork.</p>
<p class="c010">“We are all trying to talk about it,” continued Lypiatt.
“The physicists have formulated their laws, which are
after all no more than stammering provisional theories about
a part of it. The physiologists are penetrating into the
secrets of life, psychologists into the mind. And we artists
are trying to say what is revealed to us about the moral
nature, the personality of that reality, which is the
universe.”</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Mercaptan threw up his hands in affected horror.
“Oh, <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">barbaridad, barbaridad</span></i>!” Nothing less than the pure
<span class="pageno" id="Page_65">65</span>Castilian would relieve his feelings. “But all this is
meaningless.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Quite right about the chemists and physicists,” said
Shearwater. “They’re always trying to pretend that
they’re nearer the truth than we are. They take their
crude theories as facts and try to make us accept them when
we’re dealing with life. Oh, they are sacred, their theories.
Laws of Nature they call them; and they talk about their
known truths and our romantic biological fancies. What a
fuss they make when we talk about life! Bloody fools!”
said Shearwater, mild and crushing. “Nobody but a fool
could talk of mechanism in face of the kidneys. And there
are actually imbeciles who talk about the mechanism of
heredity and reproduction.”</p>
<p class="c010">“All the same,” began Mr. Mercaptan very earnestly,
anxious to deny his own life, “there are eminent authorities.
I can only quote what they say, of course. I can’t
pretend to know anything about it myself. But——”</p>
<p class="c010">“Reproduction, reproduction,” Coleman murmured the
word to himself ecstatically. “Delightful and horrifying
to think they all come to that, even the most virginal; that
they were all made for that, little she-dogs, in spite of their
china blue eyes. What sort of a mandrake shall we produce,
Zoe and I?” he asked, turning to Shearwater. “How I
should like to have a child,” he went on without waiting
for an answer. “I shouldn’t teach it anything; no
language, nothing at all. Just a child of nature. I believe
it would really be the devil. And then what fun it would
be if it suddenly started to say ‘Bekkos,’ like the children
in Herodotus. And Buonarotti here would paint an allegorical
picture of it and write an epic called ‘The Ignoble
Savage.’ And Castor Fiber would come and sound its
<span class="pageno" id="Page_66">66</span>kidneys and investigate its sexual instincts. And Mercaptan
would write one of his inimitable middle articles about it.
And Gumbril would make it a pair of patent trousers.
And Zoe and I would look parentally on and fairly swell
with pride. Shouldn’t we, Zoe?” Zoe preserved her
expression of sullen, unchanging contempt and did not
deign to answer. “Ah, how delightful it would be! I
long for posterity. I live in hopes. I stope against Stopes.
I——”</p>
<p class="c010">Zoe threw a piece of bread, which caught him on the
cheek, a little below the eye. Coleman leaned back and
laughed and laughed till the tears rolled down his face.</p>
<div class="chapter">
<span class="pageno" id="Page_67">67</span>
<h2 class="c008">CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>
<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c009">One after another, they engaged themselves in the
revolving doors of the restaurant, trotted round
in the moving cage of glass and ejected themselves
into the coolness and darkness of the street. Shearwater
lifted up his large face and took two or three deep
breaths. “Too much carbon dioxide and ammonia in
there,” he said.</p>
<p class="c010">“It is unfortunate that when two or three are
gathered together in God’s name, or even in the more
civilized name of Mercaptan of the delicious middle,”
Mercaptan dexterously parried the prod which Coleman
aimed at him, “it is altogether deplorable that they should
necessarily empest the air.”</p>
<p class="c010">Lypiatt had turned his eyes heavenwards. “What
stars,” he said, “and what prodigious gaps between the
stars!”</p>
<p class="c010">“A real light opera summer night.” And Mercaptan
began to sing, in fragmentary German, the ‘Barcarolle’
from the <cite>Tales of Hoffmann</cite>. “Liebe Nacht, du schöne
Nacht, oh stille mein tumpty-tum. Te, tum, Te tum....
Delicious Offenbach. Ah, if only we could have a third
Empire! Another comic Napoleon! That would make
Paris look like Paris again. Tiddy, tumpty-ti-tum.”</p>
<p class="c010">They walked along without any particular destination,
but simply for the sake of walking through this soft cool
night. Coleman led the way, tapping the pavement at
<span class="pageno" id="Page_68">68</span>every step with the ferrule of his stick. “The blind leading
the blind,” he explained. “Ah, if only there were a ditch,
a crevasse, a great hole full of stinging centipedes and dung.
How gleefully I should lead you all into it!”</p>
<p class="c010">“I think you would do well,” said Shearwater gravely,
“to go and see a doctor.”</p>
<p class="c010">Coleman gave vent to a howl of delight.</p>
<p class="c010">“Does it occur to you,” he went on, “that at this
moment we are walking through the midst of seven million
distinct and separate individuals, each with distinct and
separate lives and all completely indifferent to our existence?
Seven million people, each one of whom thinks himself
quite as important as each of us does. Millions of them
are now sleeping in an empested atmosphere. Hundreds
of thousands of couples are at this moment engaged in
mutually caressing one another in a manner too hideous to
be thought of, but in no way differing from the manner
in which each of us performs, delightfully, passionately
and beautifully, his similar work of love. Thousands of
women are now in the throes of parturition, and of both
sexes thousands are dying of the most diverse and appalling
diseases, or simply because they have lived too long.
Thousands are drunk, thousands have over-eaten, thousands
have not had enough to eat. And they are all alive, all
unique and separate and sensitive, like you and me. It’s
a horrible thought. Ah, if I could lead them all into that
great hole of centipedes.”</p>
<p class="c010">He tapped and tapped on the pavement in front of him,
as though searching for the crevasse. At the top of his
voice he began to chant: “O all ye Beasts and Cattle,
curse ye the Lord: curse him and vilify him for ever.”</p>
<p class="c010">“All this religion,” sighed Mercaptan. “What with
<span class="pageno" id="Page_69">69</span>Lypiatt on one side, being a muscular Christian artist, and
Coleman on the other, howling the black mass....
Really!” He elaborated an Italianate gesture, and turned
to Zoe. “What do you think of it all?” he asked.</p>
<p class="c010">Zoe jerked her head in Coleman’s direction. “I think
e’s a bloody swine,” she said. They were the first words
she had spoken since she had joined the party.</p>
<p class="c010">“Hear, hear!” cried Coleman, and he waved his
stick.</p>
<p class="c010">In the warm yellow light of the coffee-stall at Hyde Park
Corner loitered a little group of people. Among the peaked
caps and the chauffeurs’ dust-coats, among the weather-stained
workmen’s jackets and the knotted handkerchiefs,
there emerged an alien elegance. A tall tubed hat and a
silk-faced overcoat, a cloak of flame-coloured satin, and in
bright, coppery hair a great Spanish comb of carved
tortoiseshell.</p>
<p class="c010">“Well, I’m damned,” said Gumbril as they approached.
“I believe it’s Myra Viveash.”</p>
<p class="c010">“So it is,” said Lypiatt, peering in his turn. He began
suddenly to walk with an affected swagger, kicking his heels
at every step. Looking at himself from outside, his divining
eyes pierced through the veil of cynical <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">je-m’en-fichisme</span></i> to
the bruised heart beneath. Besides, he didn’t want any
one to guess.</p>
<p class="c010">“The Viveash is it?” Coleman quickened his rapping
along the pavement. “And who is the present incumbent?”
He pointed at the top hat.</p>
<p class="c010">“Can it be Bruin Opps?” said Gumbril dubiously.</p>
<p class="c010">“Opps!” Coleman yelled out the name. “Opps!”</p>
<p class="c010">The top hat turned, revealing a shirt front, a long grey
face, a glitter of circular glass over the left eye. “Who
<span class="pageno" id="Page_70">70</span>the devil are you?” The voice was harsh and arrogantly
offensive.</p>
<p class="c010">“I am that I am,” said Coleman. “But I have with
me”—he pointed to Shearwater, to Gumbril, to Zoe—“a
physiologue, a pedagogue and a priapagogue; for I
leave out of account mere artists and journalists whose
titles do not end with the magic syllable. And finally,”
indicating himself, “plain Dog, which being interpreted
kabbalistically backwards, signifies God. All at your
service.” He took off his hat and bowed.</p>
<p class="c010">The top hat turned back towards the Spanish comb.
“Who is this horrible drunk?” it inquired.</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Viveash did not answer him, but stepped forward to
meet the newcomers. In one hand she held a peeled, hard-boiled
egg and a thick slice of bread and butter in the other,
and between her sentences she bit at them alternately.</p>
<p class="c010">“Coleman!” she exclaimed, and her voice, as she spoke,
seemed always on the point of expiring, as though each
word were the last, utterly faintly and breakingly from a
death-bed—the last, with all the profound and nameless
significance of the ultimate word. “It’s a very long time
since I heard you raving last. And you, Theodore darling,
why do I never see you now?”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril shrugged his shoulders. “Because you don’t
want to, I suppose,” he said.</p>
<p class="c010">Myra laughed and took another bite at her bread and
butter.... She laid the back of her hand—for she was
still holding the butt end of her hard-boiled egg—on
Lypiatt’s arm. The Titan, who had been looking at the
sky, seemed to be surprised to find her standing there.
“You?” he said, smiling and wrinkling up his forehead
interrogatively.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_71">71</span>“It’s to-morrow I’m sitting for you, Casimir, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Ah, you remembered.” The veil parted for a moment.
Poor Lypiatt! “And happy Mercaptan? Always
happy?”</p>
<p class="c010">Gallantly Mercaptan kissed the back of the hand which
held the egg. “I might be happier,” he murmured, rolling
up at her from the snouty face a pair of small brown eyes.
“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Puis-je espérer?</span></i>”</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Viveash laughed expiringly from her inward death-bed
and turned on him, without speaking, her pale unwavering
glance. Her eyes had a formidable capacity for
looking and expressing nothing; they were like the pale
blue eyes which peer out of the Siamese cat’s black velvet
mask.</p>
<p class="c010">“<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Bellissima</span>,” murmured Mercaptan, flowering under
their cool light.</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Viveash addressed herself to the company at large.
“We have had the most appalling evening,” she said.
“Haven’t we, Bruin?”</p>
<p class="c010">Bruin Opps said nothing, but only scowled. He didn’t
like these damned intruders. The skin of his contracted
brows oozed over the rim of his monocle, on to the shining
glass.</p>
<p class="c010">“I thought it would be fun,” Myra went on, “to go to
that place at Hampton Court, where you have dinner on
an island and dance....”</p>
<p class="c010">“What is there about islands,” put in Mercaptan, in a
deliciously whimsical parenthesis, “that makes them so
peculiarly voluptuous? Cythera, Monkey Island, Capri.
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je me demande.</span></i>”</p>
<p class="c010">“Another charming middle.” Coleman pointed his stick
menacingly; Mr. Mercaptan stepped quickly out of range.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_72">72</span>“So we took a cab,” Mrs. Viveash continued, “and set
out. And what a cab, my God! A cab with only one
gear and that the lowest. A cab as old as the century, a
museum specimen, a collector’s piece.” They had been
hours and hours on the way. And when they got there,
the food they were offered to eat, the wine they were
expected to drink! From her eternal death-bed Mrs.
Viveash cried out in unaffected horror. Everything tasted
as though it has been kept soaking for a week in the river
before being served up—rather weedy, with that delicious
typhoid flavour of Thames water. There was Thames
even in the champagne. They had not been able to eat
so much as a crust of bread. Hungry and thirsty, they had
re-embarked in their antique taxi, and here, at last, they
were, at the first outpost of civilization, eating for dear
life.</p>
<p class="c010">“Oh, a terrible evening,” Mrs. Viveash concluded.
“The only thing which kept up my spirits was the spectacle
of Bruin’s bad temper. You’ve no idea, Bruin, what an
incomparable comic you can be.”</p>
<p class="c010">Bruin ignored the remark. With an expression of painfully
repressed disgust he was eating a hard-boiled egg.
Myra’s caprices were becoming more and more impossible.
That Hampton Court business had been bad enough;
but when it came to eating in the street, in the middle of
a lot of filthy workmen—well, really, that was rather too
much.</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Viveash looked about her. “Am I never to know
who this mysterious person is?” She pointed to Shearwater,
who was standing a little apart from the group, his
back leaning against the Park railings and staring thoughtfully
at the ground.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_73">73</span>“The physiologue,” Coleman explained, “and he has
the key. The key, the key!” He hammered the pavement
with his stick.</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril performed the introduction in more commonplace
style.</p>
<p class="c010">“You don’t seem to take much interest in us, Mr. Shearwater,”
Myra called expiringly. Shearwater looked up;
Mrs. Viveash regarded him intently through pale, unwavering
eyes, smiling as she looked that queer, downward-turning
smile which gave to her face, through its mask of laughter, a
peculiar expression of agony. “You don’t seem to take
much interest in us,” she repeated.</p>
<p class="c010">Shearwater shook his heavy head. “No,” he said, “I
don’t think I do.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Why don’t you?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Why should I? There’s not time to be interested in
everything. One can only be interested in what’s worth
while.”</p>
<p class="c010">“And we’re not worth while?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Not to me personally,” replied Shearwater with candour.
“The Great Wall of China, the political situation in Italy,
the habits of Trematodes—all these are most interesting
in themselves. But they aren’t interesting to me; I don’t
permit them to be. I haven’t the leisure.”</p>
<p class="c010">“And what do you allow yourself to be interested in?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Shall we go?” said Bruin impatiently; he had
succeeded in swallowing the last fragment of his hard-boiled
egg. Mrs. Viveash did not answer, did not even
look at him.</p>
<p class="c010">Shearwater, who had hesitated before replying, was
about to speak. But Coleman answered for him. “Be
respectful,” he said to Mrs. Viveash. “This is a great man.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_74">74</span>He reads no papers, not even those in which our Mercaptan
so beautifully writes. He does not know what a beaver
is. And he lives for nothing but the kidneys.”</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Viveash smiled her smile of agony. “Kidneys?
But what a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">memento mori</span></i>. There are other portions of
the anatomy.” She threw back her cloak revealing an arm,
a bare shoulder, a slant of pectoral muscle. She was wearing
a white dress that, leaving her back and shoulders bare,
came up, under either arm, to a point in front and was
held there by a golden thread about the neck. “For
example,” she said, and twisted her hand several times over
and over, making the slender arm turn at the elbow, as though
to demonstrate the movement of the articulations and the
muscular play.</p>
<p class="c010">“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Memento vivere</span></i>,” Mr. Mercaptan aptly commented.
“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vivamus, mea Lesbia, atque amemus.</span></i>”</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Viveash dropped her arm and pulled the cloak back
into place. She looked at Shearwater, who had followed
all her movements with conscientious attention, and who
now nodded with an expression of interrogation on his
face, as though to ask: what next?</p>
<p class="c010">“We all know that you’ve got beautiful arms,” said
Bruin angrily. “There’s no need for you to make an
exhibition of them in the street, at midnight. Let’s get
out of this.” He laid his hand on her shoulder and made
as if to draw her away. “We’d better be going. Goodness
knows what’s happening behind us.” He indicated
with a little movement of the head the loiterers round the
coffee-stall. “Some disturbance among the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">canaille</span></i>.”</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Viveash looked round. The cab-drivers and the
other consumers of midnight coffee had gathered in an
interested circle, curious and sympathetic, round the figure
<span class="pageno" id="Page_75">75</span>of a woman who was sitting, like a limp bundle tied up in
black cotton and mackintosh, on the stall-keeper’s high
stool, leaning wearily against the wall of the booth. A man
stood beside her drinking tea out of a thick white cup.
Every one was talking at once.</p>
<p class="c010">“Mayn’t the poor wretches talk?” asked Mrs. Viveash,
turning back to Bruin. “I never knew any one who
had the lower classes on the brain as much as you
have.”</p>
<p class="c010">“I loathe them,” said Bruin. “I hate every one poor,
or ill, or old. Can’t abide them; they make me positively
sick.”</p>
<p class="c010">“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quelle âme bien-née</span></i>,” piped Mr. Mercaptan. “And
how well and frankly you express what we all feel and lack
the courage to say.”</p>
<p class="c010">Lypiatt gave vent to indignant laughter.</p>
<p class="c010">“I remember when I was a little boy,” Bruin went on,
“my old grandfather used to tell me stories about his
childhood. He told me that when he was about five or
six, just before the passing of the Reform Bill of ’thirty-two,
there was a song which all right-thinking people used to
sing, with a chorus that went like this: ‘Rot the People,
blast the People, damn the Lower Classes.’ I wish I
knew the rest of the words and the tune. It must have
been a good song.”</p>
<p class="c010">Coleman was enraptured with the song. He shouldered
his walking-stick and began marching round and round the
nearest lamp-post chanting the words to a stirring march
tune. “Rot the People, blast the People....” He
marked the rhythm with heavy stamps of his feet.</p>
<p class="c010">“Ah, if only they’d invent servants with internal combustion
engines,” said Bruin, almost pathetically. “However
<span class="pageno" id="Page_76">76</span>well trained they are, they always betray their humanity
occasionally. And that is really intolerable.”</p>
<p class="c010">“How tedious is a guilty conscience!” Gumbril murmured
the quotation.</p>
<p class="c010">“But Mr. Shearwater,” said Myra, bringing back the
conversation to more congenial themes, “hasn’t told us
yet what he thinks of arms.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Nothing at all,” said Shearwater. “I’m occupied with
the regulation of the blood at the moment.”</p>
<p class="c010">“But is it true what he says, Theodore?” She appealed
to Gumbril.</p>
<p class="c010">“I should think so.” Gumbril’s answer was rather dim
and remote. He was straining to hear the talk of Bruin’s
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">canaille</span></i>, and Mrs. Viveash’s question seemed a little
irrelevant.</p>
<p class="c010">“I used to do cartin’ jobs,” the man with the teacup
was saying. “’Ad a van and a nold pony of me own. And
didn’t do so badly neither. The only trouble was me
lifting furniture and ’eavy weights about the place. Because
I ’ad malaria out in India, in the war....”</p>
<p class="c010">“Nor even—you compel me to violate the laws of
modesty—nor even,” Mrs. Viveash went on, smiling painfully,
speaking huskily, expiringly, “of legs?”</p>
<p class="c010">A spring of blasphemy was touched in Coleman’s brain.
“Neither delighteth He in any man’s legs,” he shouted,
and with an extravagant show of affection he embraced
Zoe, who caught hold of his hand and bit it.</p>
<p class="c010">“It comes back on you when you get tired like, malaria
does.” The man’s face was sallow and there was an air of
peculiar listlessness and hopelessness about his misery.
“It comes back on you, and then you go down with fever
and you’re as weak as a child.”</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_77">77</span>Shearwater shook his head.</p>
<p class="c010">“Nor even of the heart?” Mrs. Viveash lifted her eyebrows.
“Ah, now the inevitable word has been pronounced,
the real subject of every conversation has appeared on the
scene. Love, Mr. Shearwater!”</p>
<p class="c010">“But as I says,” recapitulated the man with the teacup,
“we didn’t do so badly after all. We ’ad nothing to
complain about. ’Ad we, Florrie?”</p>
<p class="c010">The black bundle made an affirmative movement with its
upper extremity.</p>
<p class="c010">“That’s one of the subjects,” said Shearwater, “like the
Great Wall of China and the habits of Trematodes, I don’t
allow myself to be interested in.”</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Viveash laughed, breathed out a little “Good
God!” of incredulity and astonishment, and asked, “Why
not?”</p>
<p class="c010">“No time,” he explained. “You people of leisure have
nothing else to do or think about. I’m busy and so naturally
less interested in the subject than you; and I take care,
what’s more, to limit such interest as I have.”</p>
<p class="c010">“I was goin’ up Ludgate ’Ill one day with a vanload of
stuff for a chap in Clerkenwell. I was leadin’ Jerry up the
’ill—Jerry’s the name of our ole pony....”</p>
<p class="c010">“One can’t have everything,” Shearwater was explaining,
“not all at the same time, in any case. I’ve arranged my
life for work now. I’m quietly married, I simmer away
domestically.”</p>
<p class="c010">“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quelle horreur!</span></i>” said Mr. Mercaptan. All the Louis
Quinze Abbé in him was shocked and revolted by the thought.</p>
<p class="c010">“But love?” questioned Mrs. Viveash. “Love?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Love!” Lypiatt echoed. He was looking up at the
Milky Way.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_78">78</span>“All of a sudden out jumps a copper at me. ‘’Ow old is
that ’orse?’ ’e says. ‘It ain’t fit to drawr a load, it limps
in all four feet,’ ’e says. ‘No, it doesn’t,’ I says. ‘None
of your answerin’ back,’ ’e says. ‘Take it outer the shafts
at once.’”</p>
<p class="c010">“But I know all about love already. I know precious
little still about kidneys.”</p>
<p class="c010">“But, my good Shearwater, how can you know all about
love before you’ve made it with all women?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Off we goes, me and the cop and the ’orse, up in front
of the police court magistrate....”</p>
<p class="c010">“Or are you one of those imbeciles,” Mrs. Viveash went
on, “who speak of women with a large W and pretend we’re
all the same? Poor Theodore here might possibly think so
in his feebler moments.” Gumbril smiled vaguely from a
distance. He was following the man with the teacup into
the magistrate’s stuffy court. “And Mercaptan certainly
does, because all the women who ever sat on his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dix-huitième</span></i>
sofa certainly were exactly like one another. And
perhaps Casimir does too; all women look like his absurd
ideal. But you, Shearwater, you’re intelligent. Surely
you don’t believe anything so stupid?”</p>
<p class="c010">Shearwater shook his head.</p>
<p class="c010">“The cop, ’e gave evidence against me. ‘Limping in all
four feet,’ ’e says. ‘It wasn’t,’ I says, and the police court
vet, ’e bore me out. ‘The ’orse ’as been very well treated,’
’e says. ‘But ’e’s old, ’e’s very old.’ ‘I know ’e’s old,’ I
says. ‘But where am I goin’ to find the price for a young
one?’”</p>
<p class="c010">“<em>x</em><sup>2</sup> – <em>y</em><sup>2</sup>,” Shearwater was saying, “= (<em>x</em> + <em>y</em>)(<em>x</em> – <em>y</em>).
And the equation holds good whatever the values of <em>x</em> and
<em>y</em>.... It’s the same with your love business, Mrs. Viveash.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_79">79</span>The relation is still fundamentally the same, whatever the
value of the unknown personal quantities concerned. Little
individual tics and peculiarities—after all, what do they
matter?”</p>
<p class="c010">“What indeed!” said Coleman. “Tics, mere tics.
Sheep ticks, horse ticks, bed bugs, tape worms, taint worms,
guinea worms, liver flukes....”</p>
<p class="c010">“‘The ’orse must be destroyed,” says the beak. “’E’s too
old for work.’ ‘But I’m not,’ I says. ‘I can’t get a old
age pension at thirty-two, can I? ’Ow am I to earn my
living if you take away what I earns my living by?’”</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Viveash smiled agonizingly. “Here’s a man who
thinks personal peculiarities are trivial and unimportant,”
she said. “You’re not even interested in people,
then?”</p>
<p class="c010">“‘I don’t know what you can do,’ ’e says. ‘I’m only
’ere to administer the law.’ ‘Seems a queer sort of law,’
I says. ‘What law is it?’”</p>
<p class="c010">Shearwater scratched his head. Under his formidable
black moustache he smiled at last his ingenuous, childish
smile. “No,” he said. “No, I suppose I’m not. It
hadn’t occurred to me, until you said it. But I suppose
I’m not. No.” He laughed, quite delighted, it seemed,
by this discovery about himself.</p>
<p class="c010">“‘What law is it?’ ’e says. ‘The Croolty to Animals
law. That’s what it is,’ ’e says.”</p>
<p class="c010">The smile of mockery and suffering appeared and faded.
“One of these days,” said Mrs. Viveash, “you may find
them more absorbing than you do now.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Meanwhile,” said Shearwater....</p>
<p class="c010">“I couldn’t find a job ’ere, and ’aving been workin’ on my
own, my own master like, couldn’t get unemployment pay.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_80">80</span>So when we ’eard of jobs at Portsmouth, we thought we’d
try to get one, even if it did mean walkin’ there.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Meanwhile, I have my kidneys.”</p>
<p class="c010">“‘’Opeless,’ ’e says to me, ‘quite ’opeless. More than
two hundred come for three vacancies.’ So there was
nothing for it but to walk back again. Took us four days
it did, this time. She was very bad on the way, very bad.
Being nearly six months gone. Our first it is. Things
will be ’arder still, when it comes.”</p>
<p class="c010">From the black bundle there issued a sound of quiet
sobbing.</p>
<p class="c010">“Look here,” said Gumbril, making a sudden irruption
into the conversation. “This is really too awful.” He
was consumed with indignation and pity; he felt like a
prophet in Nineveh.</p>
<p class="c010">“There are two wretched people here,” and Gumbril
told them breathlessly, what he had overheard. It was
terrible, terrible. “All the way to Portsmouth and back
again; on foot; without proper food; and the woman’s
with child.”</p>
<p class="c010">Coleman exploded with delight. “Gravid,” he kept
repeating, “gravid, gravid. The laws of gravidy, first
formulated by Newton, now recodified by the immortal
Einstein. God said, Let Newstein be, and there was light.
And God said, Let there be Light; and there was darkness
o’er the face of the earth.” He roared with laughter.</p>
<p class="c010">Between them they raised five pounds. Mrs. Viveash
undertook to give them to the black bundle. The cabmen
made way for her as she advanced; there was an uncomfortable
silence. The black bundle lifted a face that was
old and worn, like the face of a statue in the portal of a
cathedral; an old face, but one was aware somehow, that
<span class="pageno" id="Page_81">81</span>it belonged to a woman still young by the reckoning of
years. Her hands trembled as she took the notes, and when
she opened her mouth to speak her hardly articulate whisper
of gratitude, one saw that she had lost several of her teeth.</p>
<p class="c010">The party disintegrated. All went their ways: Mr.
Mercaptan to his rococo boudoir, his sweet <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">barocco</span> bedroom
in Sloane Street; Coleman and Zoe towards goodness
only knew what scenes of intimate life in Pimlico; Lypiatt
to his studio off the Tottenham Court Road, alone, silently
brooding and perhaps too consciously bowed with unhappiness.
But the unhappiness, poor Titan! was real
enough, for had he not seen Mrs. Viveash and the insufferable,
the stupid and loutish Opps driving off in one taxi?
“Must finish up with a little dancing,” Myra had huskily
uttered from that death-bed on which her restless spirit
for ever and wearily exerted itself. Obediently, Bruin had
given an address and they had driven off. But after the
dancing? Oh, was it possible that that odious, bad-blooded
young cad was her lover? And that she should
like him? It was no wonder that Lypiatt should have
walked, bent like Atlas under the weight of a world. And
when, in Piccadilly, a belated and still unsuccessful prostitute
sidled out of the darkness, as he strode by unseeing
in his misery when she squeaked up at him a despairing
“Cheer up, duckie,” Lypiatt suddenly threw up his head
and laughed titanically, with the terrible bitterness of a
noble soul in pain. Even the poor drabs at the street
corners were affected by the unhappiness that radiated
out from him, wave after throbbing wave, like music, he
liked to fancy, into the night. Even the wretched drabs.
He walked on, more desperately bowed than ever; but
met no further adventure on his way.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_82">82</span>Gumbril and Shearwater both lived in Paddington; they
set off in company up Park Lane, walking in silence. Gumbril
gave a little skip to get himself into step with his
companion. To be out of step, when steps so loudly and
flat-footedly flapped on empty pavements, was disagreeable,
he found, was embarrassing, was somehow dangerous.
Stepping, like this, out of time, one gave oneself away, so
to speak, one made the night aware of two presences, when
there might, if steps sounded in unison, be only one, heavier,
more formidable, more secure than either of the separate
two. In unison, then, they flapped up Park Lane. A
policeman and the three poets, sulking back to back on their
fountain, were the only human things besides themselves
under the mauve electric moons.</p>
<p class="c010">“It’s appalling, it’s horrible,” said Gumbril at last, after
a long, long silence, during which he had, indeed, been
relishing to the full the horror of it all. Life, don’t you
know.</p>
<p class="c010">“What’s appalling?” Shearwater inquired. He walked
with his big head bowed, his hands clasped behind his back
and clutching his hat; walked clumsily, with sudden
lurches of his whole massive anatomy. Wherever he was,
Shearwater always seemed to take up the space that two
or three ordinary people would normally occupy. Cool
fingers of wind passed refreshingly through his hair. He
was thinking of the experiment he meant to try, in the next
few days, down at the physiological laboratory. You’d
put a man on an ergometer in a heated chamber and set
him to work—hours at a time. He’d sweat, of course,
prodigiously. You’d make arrangements for collecting
the sweat, weighing it, analysing it and so on. The interesting
thing would be to see what happened at the end of a
<span class="pageno" id="Page_83">83</span>few days. The man would have got rid of so much of his
salts, that the blood composition might be altered and all
sorts of delightful consequences might follow. It ought to
be a capital experiment. Gumbril’s exclamation disturbed
him. “What’s appalling?” he asked rather irritably.</p>
<p class="c010">“Those people at the coffee-stall,” Gumbril answered.
“It’s appalling that human beings should have to live
like that. Worse than dogs.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Dogs have nothing to complain of.” Shearwater
went off at a tangent. “Nor guinea-pigs, nor rats. It’s
these blasted anti-vivisection maniacs who make all the
fuss.”</p>
<p class="c010">“But think,” cried Gumbril, “what these wretched
people have had to suffer! Walking all the way to Portsmouth
in search of work; and the woman with child. It’s
horrifying. And then, the way people of that class are
habitually treated. One has no idea of it until one has
actually been treated that way oneself. In the war, for
example, when one went to have one’s mitral murmurs
listened to by the medical board—they treated one then
as though one belonged to the lower orders, like all the rest
of the poor wretches. It was a real eye-opener. One felt
like a cow being got into a train. And to think that the
majority of one’s fellow-beings pass their whole lives being
shoved about like maltreated animals!”</p>
<p class="c010">“H’m,” said Shearwater. If you went on sweating indefinitely,
he supposed, you would end by dying.</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril looked through the railings at the profound
darkness of the park. Vast it was and melancholy, with a
string, here and there, of receding lights. “Terrible,” he
said, and repeated the word several times. “Terrible, terrible.”
All the legless soldiers grinding barrel-organs, all
<span class="pageno" id="Page_84">84</span>the hawkers of toys stamping their leaky boots in the gutters
of the Strand; at the corner of Cursitor Street and
Chancery Lane, the old woman with matches, for ever
holding to her left eye a handkerchief as yellow and dirty
as the winter fog. What was wrong with the eye? He had
never dared to look, but hurried past as though she were
not there, or sometimes, when the fog was more than
ordinarily cold and stifling, paused for an instant with
averted eyes to drop a brown coin into her tray of matches.
And then there were the murderers hanged at eight o’clock,
while one was savouring, almost with voluptuous consciousness,
the final dream-haunted doze. There was the
phthisical charwoman who used to work at his father’s
house, until she got too weak and died. There were the
lovers who turned on the gas and the ruined shopkeepers
jumping in front of trains. Had one a right to be contented
and well-fed, had one a right to one’s education and
good taste, a right to knowledge and conversation and the
leisurely complexities of love?</p>
<p class="c010">He looked once more through the railings at the park’s
impenetrable, rustic night, at the lines of beaded lamps.
He looked, and remembered another night, years ago, during
the war, when there were no lights in the park and the
electric moons above the roadway were in almost total
eclipse. He had walked up this street alone, full of melancholy
emotions which, though the cause of them was
different, were in themselves much the same as the melancholy
emotions which swelled windily up within him to-night.
He had been most horribly in love.</p>
<p class="c010">“What did you think,” he asked abruptly, “of Myra
Viveash?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Think?” said Shearwater. “I don’t know that I
<span class="pageno" id="Page_85">85</span>thought very much about her. Not a case for ratiocination
exactly, is she? She seemed to me entertaining
enough, as women go. I said I’d lunch with her on
Thursday.”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril felt, all of a sudden, the need to speak confidentially.
“There was a time,” he said in a tone that
was quite unreally airy, off-hand and disengaged, “years
ago, when I totally lost my head about her. Totally.”
Those tear-wet patches on his pillow, cold against his cheek
in the darkness; and oh, the horrible pain of weeping,
vainly, for something that was nothing, that was everything
in the world! “Towards the end of the war it was. I
remember walking up this dismal street one night, in the
pitch darkness, writhing with jealousy.” He was silent.
Spectrally, like a dim, haunting ghost, he had hung about
her; dumbly, dumbly imploring, appealing. “The weak,
silent man,” she used to call him. And once for two or
three days, out of pity, out of affection, out of a mere desire,
perhaps, to lay the tiresome ghost, she had given him what
his mournful silence implored—only to take it back, almost
as soon as accorded. That other night, when he had walked
up this street before, desire had eaten out his vitals and
his body seemed empty, sickeningly and achingly void;
jealousy was busily reminding him, with an unflagging
malice, of her beauty—of her beauty and the hateful, ruffian
hands which now caressed, the eyes which looked on it.
That was all long ago.</p>
<p class="c010">“She is certainly handsome,” said Shearwater, commenting,
at one or two removes, on Gumbril’s last remark. “I
can see that she might make any one who got involved in
her decidedly uncomfortable.” After a day or two’s continuous
sweating, it suddenly occurred to him, one might
<span class="pageno" id="Page_86">86</span>perhaps find sea-water more refreshing than fresh water.
That would be queer.</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril burst out ferociously laughing. “But there
were other times,” he went on jauntily, “when other
people were jealous of me.” Ah, revenge, revenge. In the
better world of the imagination it was possible to get one’s
own back. What fiendish vendettas were there carried to
successful ends! “I remember once writing her a quatrain
in French.” (He had written it years after the whole thing
was over, he had never sent it to any one at all; but that
was all one.) “How did it go? Ah, yes.” And he
recited, with suitable gestures:</p>
<div class="lg-container-b c011">
<div class="linegroup">

<div class="line">“‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Puisque nous sommes là, je dois,</span></div>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="c012">Rather prettily turned, I flatter myself. Rather elegantly
gross.”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril’s laughter went hooting past the Marble Arch.
It stopped rather suddenly, however, at the corner of the
Edgware Road. He had suddenly remembered Mr. Mercaptan,
and the thought depressed him.</p>
<div class="chapter">
<span class="pageno" id="Page_87">87</span>
<h2 class="c008">CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>
<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c009">It was between Whitefield Street and the Tottenham
Court Road, in a ‘heavenly Mews,’ as he liked to call it
(for he had a characteristic weakness for philosophical
paronomasia), that Casimir Lypiatt lived and worked. You
passed under an archway of bald and sooty brick—and at
night, when the green gas-lamp underneath the arch threw
livid lights and enormous architectural shadows, you could
fancy yourself at the entrance of one of Piranesi’s prisons—and
you found yourself in a long cul-de-sac, flanked on
either side by low buildings, having stabling for horses
below and, less commodiously, stabling for human beings
in the attics above. An old-fashioned smell of animals
mingled with the more progressive stink of burnt oil. The
air was a little thicker here, it seemed, than in the streets
outside; looking down the mews on even the clearest day,
you could see the forms of things dimming and softening,
the colours growing richer and deeper with every yard of
distance. It was the best place in the world, Lypiatt used
to say, for studying aerial perspective; that was why he
lived there. But you always felt about poor Lypiatt that
he was facing misfortune with a jest a little too self-consciously.</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Viveash’s taxi drove in under the Piranesian arch,
drove in slowly and as though with a gingerly reluctance
to soil its white wheels on pavements so sordid. The
cabman looked round inquiringly.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_88">88</span>“This right?” he asked.</p>
<p class="c010">With a white-gloved finger Mrs. Viveash prodded the
air two or three times, indicating that he was to drive
straight on. Half-way down the mews she rapped the
glass; the man drew up.</p>
<p class="c010">“Never been down <em>’ere</em> before,” he said, for the sake of
making a little conversation, while Mrs. Viveash fumbled
for her money. He looked at her with a polite and slightly
ironic curiosity that was frankly mingled with admiration.</p>
<p class="c010">“You’re lucky,” said Mrs. Viveash. “We poor decayed
gentlewomen—you see what we’re reduced to.” And she
handed him a florin.</p>
<p class="c010">Slowly the taxi-man unbuttoned his coat and put the
coin away in an inner pocket. He watched her as she
crossed the dirty street, placing her feet with a meticulous
precision one after the other in the same straight line, as
though she were treading a knife edge between goodness
only knew what invisible gulfs. Floating she seemed to
go, with a little spring at every step and the skirt of her
summery dress—white it was, with a florid pattern printed
in black all over it—blowing airily out around her swaying
march. Decayed gentlewomen indeed! The driver started
his machine with an unnecessary violence; he felt, for some
reason, positively indignant.</p>
<p class="c010">Between the broad double-doors through which the horses
passed to their fodder and repose were little narrow human
doors—for the Yahoos, Lypiatt used to say in his large
allusive way; and when he said it he laughed with the loud
and bell-mouthed cynicism of one who sees himself as a
misunderstood and embittered Prometheus. At one of
these little Yahoo doors Mrs. Viveash halted and rapped as
loudly as a small and stiff-hinged knocker would permit.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_89">89</span>Patiently she waited; several small and dirty children
collected to stare at her. She knocked again and again
waited. More children came running up from the farther
end of the mews; two young girls of fifteen or sixteen
appeared at a neighbouring doorway and immediately gave
tongue in whoops of mirthless, hyena-like laughter.</p>
<p class="c010">“Have you ever read about the pied piper of Hamelin?”
Mrs. Viveash asked the nearest child. Terrified, it shrank
away. “I thought not,” she said, and knocked again.</p>
<p class="c010">There was a sound, at last, of heavy feet slowly descending
steep stairs; the door opened.</p>
<p class="c010">“Welcome to the palazzo!” It was Lypiatt’s heroic
formula of hospitality.</p>
<p class="c010">“Welcome at last,” Mrs. Viveash corrected, and followed
him up a narrow, dark staircase that was as steep as a ladder.
He was dressed in a velveteen jacket and linen trousers
that should have been white, but needed washing. He was
dishevelled and his hands were dirty.</p>
<p class="c010">“Did you knock more than once?” he asked, looking
back over his shoulder.</p>
<p class="c010">“More than twenty times,” Mrs. Viveash justifiably
exaggerated.</p>
<p class="c010">“I’m infinitely sorry,” protested Lypiatt. “I get so deeply
absorbed in my work, you know. Did you wait long?”</p>
<p class="c010">“The children enjoyed it, at any rate.” Mrs. Viveash
was irritated by a suspicion, which was probably, after all,
quite unjustified, that Casimir had been rather consciously
absorbed in his work; that he had heard her first knock
and plunged the more profoundly into those depths of
absorption where the true artist always dwells, or at any
rate ought to dwell; to rise at her third appeal with a
slow, pained reluctance, cursing, perhaps, at the importunity
<span class="pageno" id="Page_90">90</span>of a world which thus noisily interrupted the
flow of his inspiration. “Queer, the way they stare at
one,” she went on, with a note in her dying voice of a petulance
that the children had not inspired. “Does one
look such a guy?”</p>
<p class="c010">Lypiatt threw open the door at the head of the stairs
and stood there on the threshold, waiting for her. “Queer?”
he repeated. “Not a bit.” And as she moved past him
into the room, he laid his hand on her shoulder and fell
into step with her, leaving the door to slam behind them.
“Merely an example of the mob’s instinctive dislike of the
aristocratic individual. That’s all. ‘Oh, why was I
born with a different face?’ Thank God I was, though.
And so were you. But the difference has its disadvantages;
the children throw stones.”</p>
<p class="c010">“They didn’t throw stones.” Mrs. Viveash was too
truthful, this time.</p>
<p class="c010">They halted in the middle of the studio. It was not a
very large room and there were too many things in it.
The easel stood near the centre of the studio; round it
Lypiatt kept a space permanently cleared. There was a
broad fairway leading to the door, and another, narrower
and tortuously winding between boxes and piled-up furniture
and tumbled books, gave access to his bed. There
was a piano and a table permanently set with dirty plates
and strewed with the relics of two or three meals. Bookshelves
stood on either side of the fireplace and lying on the
floor were still more books, piles on dusty piles. Mrs.
Viveash stood looking at the picture on the easel (abstract
again—she didn’t like it), and Lypiatt, who had dropped his
hand from her shoulder, had stepped back the better to
see her, stood earnestly looking at Mrs. Viveash.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_91">91</span>“May I kiss you?” he asked after a silence.</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Viveash turned towards him, smiling agonizingly,
her eyebrows ironically lifted, her eyes steady and calm and
palely, brightly inexpressive. “If it really gives you any
pleasure,” she said. “It won’t, I may say, to me.”</p>
<p class="c010">“You make me suffer a great deal,” said Lypiatt, and said
it so quietly and unaffectedly, that Myra was almost
startled; she was accustomed, with Casimir, to noisier and
more magniloquent protestations.</p>
<p class="c010">“I’m very sorry,” she said; and, really, she felt sorry.
“But I can’t help it, can I?”</p>
<p class="c010">“I suppose you can’t,” he said. “You can’t,” he repeated
and his voice had now become the voice of Prometheus
in his bitterness. “Nor can tigresses.” He had
begun to pace up and down the unobstructed fairway
between his easel and the door; Lypiatt liked pacing while
he talked. “You like playing with the victim,” he went
on; “he must die slowly.”</p>
<p class="c010">Reassured, Mrs. Viveash faintly smiled. This was the
familiar Casimir. So long as he could talk like this, could
talk like an old-fashioned French novel, it was all right;
he couldn’t really be so very unhappy. She sat down on
the nearest unencumbered chair. Lypiatt continued to
walk back and forth, waving his arms as he walked.</p>
<p class="c010">“But perhaps it’s good for one to suffer,” he went on,
“perhaps it’s unavoidable and necessary. Perhaps I ought
to thank you. Can an artist do anything if he’s happy?
Would he ever want to do anything? What is art, after
all, but a protest against the horrible inclemency of life?”
He halted in front of her, with arms extended in a questioning
gesture. Mrs. Viveash slightly shrugged her shoulders.
She really didn’t know; she couldn’t answer. “Ah, but
<span class="pageno" id="Page_92">92</span>that’s all nonsense,” he burst out again, “all rot. I want
to be happy and contented and successful; and of course
I should work better if I were. And I want, oh, above
everything, everything, I want you: to possess you completely
and exclusively and jealously and for ever. And
the desire is like rust corroding my heart, it’s like moth
eating holes in the fabric of my mind. And you merely
laugh.” He threw up his hands and let them limply fall
again.</p>
<p class="c010">“But I don’t laugh,” said Mrs. Viveash. On the contrary,
she was very sorry for him; and, what was more, he rather
bored her. For a few days, once, she had thought she
might be in love with him. His impetuosity had seemed
a torrent strong enough to carry her away. She had found
out her mistake very soon. After that he had rather amused
her: and now he rather bored her. No, decidedly, she
never laughed. She wondered why she still went on seeing
him. Simply because one must see some one? or why?
“Are you going to go on with my portrait?” she asked.</p>
<p class="c010">Lypiatt sighed. “Yes,” he said, “I suppose I’d better
be getting on with my work. Work—it’s the only thing.
‘Portrait of a Tigress.’” The cynical Titan spoke again.
“Or shall I call it, ‘Portrait of a Woman who has never been
in Love?’”</p>
<p class="c010">“That would be a very stupid title,” said Mrs. Viveash.</p>
<p class="c010">“Or, ‘Portrait of the Artist’s Heart Disease’? That
would be good, that would be damned good!” Lypiatt
laughed very loudly and slapped his thighs. He looked,
Mrs. Viveash thought, peculiarly ugly when he laughed.
His face seemed to go all to pieces; not a corner of it but
was wrinkled and distorted by the violent grimace of mirth.
Even the forehead was ruined when he laughed. Foreheads
<span class="pageno" id="Page_93">93</span>are generally the human part of people’s faces. Let
the nose twitch and the mouth grin and the eyes twinkle
as monkeyishly as you like; the forehead can still be calm
and serene, the forehead still knows how to be human.
But when Casimir laughed, his forehead joined in the
general disintegrating grimace. And sometimes even when
he wasn’t laughing, when he was just vivaciously talking,
his forehead seemed to lose its calm and would twitch and
wrinkle itself in a dreadful kind of agitation. ‘Portrait of
the Artist’s Heart Disease’—she didn’t find it so very funny.</p>
<p class="c010">“The critics would think it was a problem picture,”
Lypiatt went on. “And so it would be, by God, so it
would be. You <em>are</em> a problem. You’re the Sphinx. I
wish I were Œdipus and could kill you.”</p>
<p class="c010">All this mythology! Mrs. Viveash shook her head.</p>
<p class="c010">He made his way through the intervening litter and
picked up a canvas that was leaning with averted face
against the wall near the window. He held it out at arm’s
length and examined it, his head critically cocked on one
side. “Oh, it’s good,” he said softly. “It’s good. Look
at it.” And, stepping out once more into the open, he
propped it up against the table so that Mrs. Viveash could
see it without moving from her chair.</p>
<p class="c010">It was a stormy vision of her; it was Myra seen, so to
speak, through a tornado. He had distorted her in the
portrait, had made her longer and thinner than she really
was, had turned her arms into sleek tubes and put a bright,
metallic polish on the curve of her cheek. The figure in
the portrait seemed to be leaning backwards a little from
the surface of the canvas, leaning sideways too, with the
twist of an ivory statuette carved out of the curving tip of
a great tusk. Only somehow in Lypiatt’s portrait the curve
<span class="pageno" id="Page_94">94</span>seemed to lack grace, it was without point, it had no
sense.</p>
<p class="c010">“You’ve made me look,” said Mrs. Viveash at last, “as
though I were being blown out of shape by the wind.”
All this show of violence—what was the point of it? She
didn’t like it, she didn’t like it at all. But Casimir
was delighted with her comment. He slapped his thighs
and once more laughed his restless, sharp-featured face to
pieces.</p>
<p class="c010">“Yes, by God,” he shouted, “by God, that’s right!
Blown out of shape by the wind. That’s it: you’ve said
it.” He began stamping up and down the room again,
gesticulating. “The wind, the great wind that’s in me.”
He struck his forehead. “The wind of life, the wild west
wind. I feel it inside me, blowing, blowing. It carries
me along with it; for though it’s inside me, it’s more than
I am, it’s a force that comes from somewhere else, it’s Life
itself, it’s God. It blows me along in the teeth of opposing
fate, it makes me work on, fight on.” He was like a man
who walks along a sinister road at night and sings to keep
up his own spirits, to emphasize and magnify his own
existence. “And when I paint, when I write or improvise
my music, it bends the things I have in my mind, it pushes
them in one direction, so that everything I do has the look
of a tree that streams north-east with all its branches and
all its trunk from the root upwards, as though it were
trying to run from before the Atlantic gale.”</p>
<p class="c010">Lypiatt stretched out his two hands and, with fingers
splayed out to the widest and trembling in the excessive
tension of the muscles, moved them slowly upwards and
sideways, as though he were running his palms up the stem
of a little wind-wizened tree on a hilltop above the ocean.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_95">95</span>Mrs. Viveash continued to look at the unfinished portrait.
It was as noisy and easy and immediately effective as a Vermouth
advertisement in the streets of Padua. Cinzano,
Bonomelli, Campari—illustrious names. Giotto and Mantegna
mouldered meanwhile in their respective chapels.</p>
<p class="c010">“And look at this,” Lypiatt went on. He took down the
canvas that was clamped to the easel and held it out for
her inspection. It was one of Casimir’s abstract paintings:
a procession of machine-like forms rushing up diagonally
from right to left across the canvas, with as it were a spray
of energy blowing back from the crest of the wave towards
the top right-hand corner. “In this painting,” he said,
“I symbolize the Artist’s conquering spirit—rushing on the
universe, making it its own.” He began to declaim:</p>
<div class="lg-container-b c011">
<div class="linegroup">
<div class="group">
<div class="line">“Look down, Conquistador,</div>
<div class="line">There on the valley’s broad green floor,</div>
<div class="line">There lies the lake, the jewelled cities gleam,</div>
<div class="line">Chalco and Tlacopan</div>
<div class="line">Awaiting the coming Man;</div>
<div class="line">Look down on Mexico, Conquistador,</div>
<div class="line">Land of your golden dream.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="c012">Or the same idea in terms of music——” and Lypiatt dashed
to the piano and evoked a distorted ghost of Scriabin.
“You see?” he asked feverishly, when the ghost was laid
again and the sad cheap jangling had faded again into
silence. “You <em>feel</em>? The artist rushes on the world,
conquers it, gives it beauty, imposes a moral significance.”
He returned to the picture. “This will be fine when it’s
finished,” he said. “Tremendous. You feel the wind
blowing there, too.” And with a pointing finger he
followed up the onrush of the forms. “The great southwester
<span class="pageno" id="Page_96">96</span>driving them on. ‘Like leaves from an enchanter
fleeing.’ Only not chaotically, not in disorder. They’re
blown, so to speak, in column of four—by a conscious
wind.” He leaned the canvas against the table and was
free again to march and brandish his conquering fists.</p>
<p class="c010">“Life,” he said, “life—that’s the great, essential thing.
You’ve got to get life into your art, otherwise it’s nothing.
And life only comes out of life, out of passion and feeling;
it can’t come out of theories. That’s the stupidity of all
this chatter about art for art’s sake and the æsthetic emotions
and purely formal values and all that. It’s only the formal
relations that matter; one subject is just as good as another—that’s
the theory. You’ve only got to look at the
pictures of the people who put it into practice to see that
it won’t do. Life comes out of life. You must paint
with passion and the passion will stimulate your intellect
to create the right formal relations. And to paint with
passion, you must paint things that passionately interest
you, moving things, human things. Nobody, except a
mystical pantheist, like Van Gogh, can seriously be as much
interested in napkins, apples and bottles as in his lover’s
face, or the resurrection, or the destiny of man. Could
Mantegna have devised his splendid compositions if he
had painted arrangements of Chianti flasks and cheeses
instead of Crucifixions, martyrs and triumphs of great men?
Nobody but a fool could believe it. And could I have
painted that portrait if I hadn’t loved you, if you weren’t
killing me?”</p>
<p class="c010">Ah, Bonomelli and illustrious Cinzano!</p>
<p class="c010">“Passionately I paint passion. I draw life out of life.
And I wish them joy of their bottles and their Canadian
apples and their muddy table napkins with the beastly folds
<span class="pageno" id="Page_97">97</span>in them that look like loops of tripe.” Once more Lypiatt
disintegrated himself with laughter; then was silent.</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Viveash nodded, slowly and reflectively. “I think
you’re right,” she said. Yes, he was surely right; there
must be life, life was the important thing. That was precisely
why his paintings were so bad—she saw now; there
was no life in them. Plenty of noise there was, and gesticulation
and a violent galvanized twitching; but no life, only
the theatrical show of it. There was a flaw in the conduit;
somewhere between the man and his work life leaked out.
He protested too much. But it was no good; there was
no disguising the deadness. Her portrait was a dancing
mummy. He bored her now. Did she even positively
dislike him? Behind her unchanging pale eyes Mrs. Viveash
wondered. But in any case, she reflected, one needn’t
always like the people with whom one associates. There
are music halls as well as confidential boudoirs; some people
are admitted to the tea-party and the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</span></i>, others,
on a stage invisible, poor things! to themselves, do their
little song-and-dance, roll out their characteristic patter,
and having provided you with your entertainment are
dismissed with their due share of applause. But then,
what if they become boring?</p>
<p class="c010">“Well,” said Lypiatt at last—he had stood there, motionless,
for a long time, biting his nails, “I suppose we’d better
begin our sitting.” He picked up the unfinished portrait
and adjusted it on the easel. “I’ve wasted a lot of time,”
he said, “and there isn’t, after all, so much of it to waste.”
He spoke gloomily, and his whole person had become, all of
a sudden, curiously shrunken and deflated. “There isn’t
so much of it,” he repeated, and sighed. “I still think
of myself as a young man, young and promising, don’t you
<span class="pageno" id="Page_98">98</span>know. Casimir Lypiatt—it’s a young, promising sort of
name, isn’t it? But I’m not young, I’ve passed the age of
promise. Every now and then I realize it, and it’s painful,
it’s depressing.”</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Viveash stepped up on to the model’s dais and took
her seat. “Is that right?” she asked.</p>
<p class="c010">Lypiatt looked first at her, then at his picture. Her
beauty, his passion—were they only to meet on the canvas?
Opps was her lover. Time was passing; he felt tired.
“That’ll do,” he said and began painting. “How young
are you?” he asked after a moment.</p>
<p class="c010">“Twenty-five, I should imagine,” said Mrs. Viveash.</p>
<p class="c010">“Twenty-five? Good Lord, it’s nearly fifteen years
since I was twenty-five. Fifteen years, fighting all the
time. God, how I hate people sometimes! Everybody.
It’s not their malignity I mind; I can give them back as
good as they give me. It’s their power of silence and indifference,
it’s their capacity for making themselves deaf.
Here am I with something to say to them, something important
and essential. And I’ve been saying it for more
than fifteen years, I’ve been shouting it. They pay no
attention. I bring them my head and heart on a charger,
and they don’t even notice that the things are there. I
sometimes wonder how much longer I can manage to go
on.” His voice had become very low, and it trembled.
“One’s nearly forty, you know....” The voice faded
huskily away into silence. Languidly and as though the
business exhausted him, he began mixing colours on his
palette.</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Viveash looked at him. No, he wasn’t young; at
the moment, indeed, he seemed to have become much older
than he really was. An old man was standing there, peaked
<span class="pageno" id="Page_99">99</span>and sharp and worn. He had failed, he was unhappy.
But the world would have been unjuster, less discriminating
if it had given him success.</p>
<p class="c010">“Some people believe in you,” she said; there was
nothing else for her to say.</p>
<p class="c010">Lypiatt looked up at her. “You?” he asked.</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Viveash nodded, deliberately. It was a lie. But
was it possible to tell the truth? “And then there is the
future,” she reassured him, and her faint death-bed voice
seemed to prophesy with a perfect certainty. “You’re
not forty yet; you’ve got twenty, thirty years of work in
front of you. And there were others, after all, who had to
wait—a long time—sometimes till after they were dead.
Great men; Blake, for instance....” She felt positively
ashamed; it was like a little talk by Doctor Frank Crane.
But she felt still more ashamed, when she saw that Casimir
had begun to cry and that the tears were rolling, one after
another, slowly down his face.</p>
<p class="c010">He put down his palette, he stepped on to the dais, he
came and knelt at Mrs. Viveash’s feet. He took one of her
hands between his own and he bent over it, pressing it to
his forehead, as though it were a charm against unhappy
thoughts, sometimes kissing it; soon it was wet with tears.
He wept almost in silence.</p>
<p class="c010">“It’s all right,” Mrs. Viveash kept repeating, “it’s all
right,” and she laid her free hand on his bowed head, she
patted it comfortingly as one might pat the head of a large
dog that comes and thrusts its muzzle between one’s knees.
She felt, even as she made it, how meaningless and unintimate
the gesture was. If she had liked him, she would
have run her fingers through his hair; but somehow his
hair rather disgusted her. “It’s all right, all right.” But,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_100">100</span>of course, it wasn’t all right; and she was comforting him
under false pretences and he was kneeling at the feet of
somebody who simply wasn’t there—so utterly detached, so
far away she was from all this scene and all his misery.</p>
<p class="c010">“You’re the only person,” he said at last, “who cares or
understands.”</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Viveash could almost have laughed.</p>
<p class="c010">He began once more to kiss her hand.</p>
<p class="c010">“Beautiful and enchanting Myra—you were always that.
But now you’re good and dear as well, now I know you’re
kind.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Poor Casimir!” she said. Why was it that people
always got involved in one’s life? If only one could manage
things on the principle of the railways! Parallel tracks—that
was the thing. For a few miles you’d be running at
the same speed. There’d be delightful conversation out
of the windows; you’d exchange the omelette in your
restaurant car for the vol-au-vent in theirs. And when
you’d said all there was to say, you’d put on a little more
steam, wave your hand, blow a kiss and away you’d go,
forging ahead along the smooth, polished rails. But instead
of that, there were these dreadful accidents; the points
were wrongly set, the trains came crashing together; or
people jumped on as you were passing through the stations
and made a nuisance of themselves and wouldn’t allow
themselves to be turned off. Poor Casimir! But he
irritated her, he was a horrible bore. She ought to have
stopped seeing him.</p>
<p class="c010">“You can’t wholly dislike me, then?”</p>
<p class="c010">“But of course not, my poor Casimir!”</p>
<p class="c010">“If you knew how horribly I loved you!” He looked
up at her despairingly.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_101">101</span>“But what’s the good?” said Mrs. Viveash.</p>
<p class="c010">“Have you ever known what it’s like to love some one so
much that you feel you could die of it? So that it hurts
all the time. As though there were a wound. Have you
ever known that?”</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Viveash smiled her agonizing smile, nodded slowly
and said, “Perhaps. And one doesn’t die, you know. One
doesn’t die.”</p>
<p class="c010">Lypiatt was leaning back, staring fixedly up at her. The
tears were dry on his face, his cheeks were flushed. “Do
you know what it is,” he asked, “to love so much, that
you begin to long for the anodyne of physical pain to
quench the pain in the soul? You don’t know that.” And
suddenly, with his clenched fist, he began to bang the
wooden dais on which he was kneeling, blow after blow,
with all his strength.</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Viveash leant forward and tried to arrest his hand.
“You’re mad, Casimir,” she said. “You’re mad. Don’t
do that.” She spoke with anger.</p>
<p class="c010">Lypiatt laughed till his face was all broken up with the
grimace, and proffered for her inspection his bleeding
knuckles. The skin hung in little white tags and tatters,
and from below the blood was slowly oozing up to the
surface. “Look,” he said, and laughed again. Then
suddenly, with an extraordinary agility, he jumped to his
feet, bounded from the dais and began once more to stride
up and down the fairway between his easel and the door.</p>
<p class="c010">“By God,” he kept repeating, “by God, by God. I
feel it in me. I can face the whole lot of you; the whole
damned lot. Yes, and I shall get the better of you yet.
An Artist”—he called up that traditional ghost and it
comforted him; he wrapped himself with a protective
<span class="pageno" id="Page_102">102</span>gesture within the ample folds of its bright mantle—“an
Artist doesn’t fail under unhappiness. He gets new
strength from it. The torture makes him sweat new
masterpieces....”</p>
<p class="c010">He began to talk about his books, his poems and pictures;
all the great things in his head, the things he had already
done. He talked about his exhibition—ah, by God, that
would astonish them, that would bowl them over, this
time. The blood mounted to his face; there was a flush
over the high projecting cheek-bones. He could feel the
warm blood behind his eyes. He laughed aloud; he was
a laughing lion. He stretched out his arms; he was
enormous, his arms reached out like the branches of a cedar.
The Artist walked across the world and the mangy dogs
ran yelping and snapping behind him. The great wind
blew and blew, driving him on; it lifted him and he began
to fly.</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Viveash listened. It didn’t look as though he
would get much further with the portrait.</p>

<h2 class="c008">CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>
<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c009">It was Press Day. The critics had begun to arrive;
Mr. Albemarle circulated among them with a ducal
amiability. The young assistant hovered vaguely
about, straining to hear what the great men had to say and
trying to pretend that he wasn’t eavesdropping. Lypiatt’s
pictures hung on the walls, and Lypiatt’s catalogue, thick
with its preface and its explanatory notes, was in all hands.</p>
<p class="c010">“Very strong,” Mr. Albemarle kept repeating, “very
strong indeed!” It was his password for the day.</p>
<p class="c010">Little Mr. Clew, who represented the <cite>Daily Post</cite>, was
inclined to be enthusiastic. “How well he writes!” he
said to Mr. Albemarle, looking up from the catalogue.
“And how well he paints! What <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">impasto</span></i>.”</p>
<p class="c010"><i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Impasto, impasto</span></i>—the young assistant sidled off unobtrusively
to the desk and made a note of it. He would look
the word up in Grubb’s <cite>Dictionary of Art and Artists</cite> later
on. He made his way back, circuitously and as though by
accident, into Mr. Clew’s neighbourhood.</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Clew was one of those rare people who have a real
passion for art. He loved painting, all painting, indiscriminately.
In a picture gallery he was like a Turk in a
harem; he adored them all. He loved Memling as much
as Raphael, he loved Grünewald and Michelangelo, Holman
Hunt and Manet, Romney and Tintoretto; how happy he
could be with all of them! Sometimes, it is true, he hated;
but that was only when familiarity had not yet bred love.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_104">104</span>At the first Post-Impressionist Exhibition, for example,
in 1911, he had taken a very firm stand. “This is an
obscene farce,” he had written then. Now, however,
there was no more passionate admirer of Matisse’s genius.
As a connoisseur and <em>kunstforscher</em>, Mr. Clew was much
esteemed. People would bring him dirty old pictures to
look at, and he would exclaim at once: Why, it’s an El
Greco, a Piazetta, or some other suitable name. Asked
how he knew, he would shrug his shoulders and say: But
it’s signed all over. His certainty and his enthusiasm were
infectious. Since the coming of El Greco into fashion, he
had discovered dozens of early works by that great artist.
For Lord Petersfield’s collection alone he had found four
early El Grecos, all by pupils of Bassano. Lord Petersfield’s
confidence in Mr. Clew was unbounded; not even that
affair of the Primitives had shaken it. It was a sad affair:
Lord Petersfield’s Duccio had shown signs of cracking; the
estate carpenter was sent for to take a look at the panel;
he had looked. “A worse-seasoned piece of Illinois hickory,”
he said, “I’ve never seen.” After that he looked at the
Simone Martini; for that, on the contrary, he was full of
praise. Smooth-grained, well-seasoned—it wouldn’t crack,
no, not in a hundred years. “A nicer slice of board never
came out of America.” He had a hyperbolical way of
speaking. Lord Petersfield was extremely angry; he dismissed
the estate carpenter on the spot. After that he told
Mr. Clew that he wanted a Giorgione, and Mr. Clew went
out and found him one which was signed all over.</p>
<p class="c010">“I like this very much,” said Mr. Clew, pointing to one
of the thoughts with which Lypiatt had prefaced his catalogue.
“‘Genius,’” he adjusted his spectacles and began
to read aloud, “‘is life. Genius is a force of nature. In
<span class="pageno" id="Page_105">105</span>art, nothing else counts. The modern impotents, who are
afraid of genius and who are envious of it, have invented in
self-defence the notion of the Artist. The Artist with his
sense of form, his style, his devotion to pure beauty, et
cetera, et cetera. But Genius includes the Artist; every
Genius has, among very many others, the qualities attributed
by the impotents to the Artist. The Artist without genius
is a carver of fountains through which no water flows.’
Very true,” said Mr. Clew, “very true indeed.” He marked
the passage with his pencil.</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Albemarle produced the password. “Very strongly
put,” he said.</p>
<p class="c010">“I have always felt that myself,” said Mr. Clew. “El
Greco, for example....”</p>
<p class="c010">“Good morning, what about El Greco?” said a voice,
all in one breath. The thin, long, skin-covered skeleton
of Mr. Mallard hung over them like a guilty conscience.
Mr. Mallard wrote every week in the <cite>Hebdomadal Digest</cite>.
He had an immense knowledge of art, and a sincere dislike
of all that was beautiful. The only modern painter whom
he really admired was Hodler. All others were treated by
him with a merciless savagery; he tore them to pieces in
his weekly articles with all the holy gusto of a Calvinist
iconoclast smashing images of the Virgin.</p>
<p class="c010">“What about El Greco?” he repeated. He had a
peculiarly passionate loathing of El Greco.</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Clew smiled up at him propitiatingly; he was afraid
of Mr. Mallard. His enthusiasms were no match for Mr.
Mallard’s erudite and logical disgusts. “I was merely
quoting him as an example,” he said.</p>
<p class="c010">“An example, I hope, of incompetent drawing, baroque
composition, disgusting forms, garish colouring and hysterical
<span class="pageno" id="Page_106">106</span>subject-matter.” Mr. Mallard showed his old ivory
teeth in a menacing smile. “Those are the only things
which El Greco’s work exemplifies.”</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Clew gave a nervous little laugh. “What do you
think of these?” he asked, pointing to Lypiatt’s canvases.</p>
<p class="c010">“They look to me very ordinarily bad,” answered Mr.
Mallard.</p>
<p class="c010">The young assistant listened appalled. In a business
like this, how was it possible to make good?</p>
<p class="c010">“All the same,” said Mr. Clew courageously, “I like
that bowl of roses in the window with the landscape behind.
Number twenty-nine.” He looked in the catalogue.
“And there’s a really charming little verse about it:</p>
<div class="lg-container-b c011">
<div class="linegroup">
<div class="group">
<div class="line">‘O beauty of the rose,</div>
<div class="line">Goodness as well as perfume exhaling!</div>
<div class="line">Who gazes on these flowers,</div>
<div class="line">On this blue hill and ripening field—he knows</div>
<div class="line">Where duty leads and that the nameless Powers</div>
<div class="line">In a rose can speak their will.’</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="c012">Really charming!” Mr. Clew made another mark with
his pencil.</p>
<p class="c010">“But commonplace, commonplace.” Mr. Mallard
shook his head. “And in any case a verse can’t justify
a bad picture. What an unsubtle harmony of colour!
And how uninteresting the composition is! That receding
diagonal—it’s been worked to death.” He too made a mark
in his catalogue—a cross and a little circle, arranged like
the skull and cross-bones on a pirate’s flag. Mr. Mallard’s
catalogues were always covered with these little marks:
they were his symbols of condemnation.</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Albemarle, meanwhile, had moved away to greet the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_107">107</span>new arrivals. To the critic of the <cite>Daily Cinema</cite> he had to
explain that there were no portraits of celebrities. The
reporter from the <cite>Evening Planet</cite> had to be told which were
the best pictures.</p>
<p class="c010">“Mr. Lypiatt,” he dictated, “is a poet and philosopher
as well as a painter. His catalogue is a—h’m—declaration
of faith.”</p>
<p class="c010">The reporter took it down in shorthand. “And very
nice too,” he said. “I’m most grateful to you, sir, most
grateful.” And he hurried away, to get to the Cattle Show
before the King should arrive. Mr. Albemarle affably
addressed himself to the critic of the <cite>Morning Globe</cite>.</p>
<p class="c010">“I <em>al</em>ways regard this gallery,” said a loud and cheerful
voice, full of bulls and canaries in chorus, “as positively a
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mauvais lieu</span></i>. Such exhibitions!” And Mr. Mercaptan
shrugged his shoulders expressively. He halted to wait for
his companion.</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Viveash had lagged behind, reading the catalogue as she
slowly walked along. “It’s a complete book,” she said, “full
of poems and essays and short stories even, so far as I can see.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Oh, the usual cracker mottoes.” Mr. Mercaptan
laughed. “I know the sort of thing. ‘Look after the
past and the future will look after itself.’ ‘God squared
minus Man squared equals Art-plus-life times Art-minus-Life.’
‘The Higher the Art the fewer the morals’—only
that’s too nearly good sense to have been invented by
Lypiatt. But I know the sort of thing. I could go on like
that for ever.” Mr. Mercaptan was delighted with himself.</p>
<p class="c010">“I’ll read you one of them,” said Mrs. Viveash. “‘A
picture is a chemical combination of plastic form and
spiritual significance.’”</p>
<p class="c010">“Crikey!” said Mr. Mercaptan.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_108">108</span>“‘Those who think that a picture is a matter of nothing
but plastic form are like those who imagine that water is
made of nothing but hydrogen.’”</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Mercaptan made a grimace. “What writing!” he
exclaimed; “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le style c’est l’homme</span></i>. Lypiatt hasn’t got a
style. Argal—inexorable conclusion—Lypiatt doesn’t exist.
My word, though. Look at those horrible great nudes
there. Like Carracis with cubical muscles.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Sampson and Delilah,” said Mrs. Viveash. “Would
you like me to read about them?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Certainly not.”</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Viveash did not press the matter. Casimir, she
thought, must have been thinking of her when he wrote
this little poem about Poets and Women, crossed genius,
torments, the sweating of masterpieces. She sighed.
“Those leopards are rather nice,” she said, and looked at
the catalogue again. “‘An animal is a symbol and its
form is significant. In the long process of adaptation,
evolution has refined and simplified and shaped, till every
part of the animal expresses one desire, a single idea. Man,
who has become what he is, not by specialization, but by
generalization, symbolizes with his body no one thing. He
is a symbol of everything from the most hideous and ferocious
bestiality to godhead.’”</p>
<p class="c010">“Dear me,” said Mr. Mercaptan.</p>
<p class="c010">A canvas of mountains and enormous clouds like nascent
sculptures presented itself.</p>
<p class="c010">“‘Aerial Alps’” Mrs. Viveash began to read.</p>
<div class="lg-container-b c011">
<div class="linegroup">
<div class="group">
<div class="line">“‘Aerial Alps of amber and of snow,</div>
<div class="line">Junonian flesh, and bosomy alabaster</div>
<div class="line">Carved by the wind’s uncertain hands....’”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_109">109</span>Mr. Mercaptan stopped his ears. “Please, please,” he
begged.</p>
<p class="c010">“Number seventeen,” said Mrs. Viveash, “is called
‘Woman on a Cosmic background,’” A female figure
stood leaning against a pillar on a hilltop, and beyond was
a blue night with stars. “Underneath is written: ‘For
one at least, she is more than the starry universe.’” Mrs.
Viveash remembered that Lypiatt had once said very much
that sort of thing to her. “So many of Casimir’s things
remind me,” she said, “of those Italian vermouth advertisements.
You know—Cinzano, Bonomelli and all these. I
wish they didn’t. This woman in white with her head
in the Great Bear....” She shook her head. “Poor
Casimir.”</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Mercaptan roared and squealed with laughter.
“Bonomelli,” he said; “that’s precisely it. What a
critic, Myra! I take off my hat.” They moved on.
“And what’s this grand transformation scene?” he
asked.</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Viveash looked at the catalogue. “It’s called
‘The Sermon on the Mount,’” she said. “And really,
do you know, I rather like it. All that crowd of figures
slanting up the hill and the single figure on the top—it
seems to me very dramatic.”</p>
<p class="c010">“My <em>dear</em>,” protested Mr. Mercaptan.</p>
<p class="c010">“And in spite of everything,” said Mrs. Viveash, feeling
suddenly and uncomfortably that she had somehow
been betraying the man, “he’s really very nice, you know.
Very nice, indeed.” Her expiring voice sounded very
decidedly.</p>
<p class="c010">“Ah, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ces femmes</span></i>,” exclaimed Mr. Mercaptan, “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ces
femmes</span></i>! They’re all Pasiphaes and Ledas. They all in
<span class="pageno" id="Page_110">110</span>their hearts prefer beasts to men, savages to civilized beings.
<em>Even</em> you, Myra, I <em>really</em> believe.” He shook his head.</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Viveash ignored the outburst. “Very nice,” she
repeated thoughtfully. “Only rather a bore....” Her
voice expired altogether.</p>
<p class="c010">They continued their round of the gallery.</p>
<div class="chapter">
<span class="pageno" id="Page_111">111</span>
<h2 class="c008">CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>
<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c009">Critically, in the glasses of Mr. Bojanus’s fitting-room,
Gumbril examined his profile, his back
view. Inflated, the Patent Small-Clothes bulged,
bulged decidedly, though with a certain gracious opulence
that might, in a person of the other sex, have seemed only
deliciously natural. In him, however, Gumbril had to
admit, the opulence seemed a little misplaced and paradoxical.
Still, if one has to suffer in order to be beautiful,
one must also expect to be ugly in order not to suffer.
Practically, the trousers were a tremendous success. He
sat down heavily on the hard wooden bench of the fitting-room
and was received as though on a lap of bounding
resiliency; the Patent Small-Clothes, there was no doubt,
would be proof even against marble. And the coat, he
comforted himself, would mask with its skirts the too
decided bulge. Or if it didn’t, well, there was no help for
it. One must resign oneself to bulging, that was all.</p>
<p class="c010">“Very nice,” he declared at last.</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Bojanus, who had been watching his client in silence
and with a polite but also, Gumbril could not help feeling,
a somewhat ironical smile, coughed. “It depends,” he
said, “precisely what you mean by ‘nice.’” He cocked
his head on one side, and the fine waxed end of his moustache
was like a pointer aimed up at some remote star.</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril said nothing, but catching sight once more of
his own side view, nodded a dubious agreement.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_112">112</span>“If by nice,” continued Mr. Bojanus, “you mean comfortable,
well and good. If, however, you mean elegant,
then, Mr. Gumbril, I fear I must disagree.”</p>
<p class="c010">“But elegance,” said Gumbril, feebly playing the philosopher,
“is only relative, Mr. Bojanus. There are certain
African negroes, among whom it is considered elegant to
pierce the lips and distend them with wooden plates, until
the mouth looks like a pelican’s beak.”</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Bojanus placed his hand in his bosom and slightly
bowed. “Very possibly, Mr. Gumbril,” he replied.
“But if you’ll pardon my saying so, we are not African
negroes.”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril was crushed, deservedly. He looked at himself
again in the mirrors. “Do you object,” he asked after a
pause, “to all eccentricities in dress, Mr. Bojanus? Would
you put us all into your elegant uniform?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Certainly not,” replied Mr. Bojanus. “There are
certain walks of life in which eccentricity in appearance is
positively a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine qua non</span></i>, Mr. Gumbril, and I might almost
say <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de rigueur</span></i>.”</p>
<p class="c010">“And which walks of life, Mr. Bojanus, may I ask?
You refer, perhaps, to the artistic walks? Sombreros
and Byronic collars and possibly velveteen trousers?
Though all that sort of thing is surely a little out of date,
nowadays.”</p>
<p class="c010">Enigmatically Mr. Bojanus smiled, a playful Sphinx.
He thrust his right hand deeper into his bosom and with
his left twisted to a finer needle the point of his moustache.
“Not artists, Mr. Gumbril.” He shook his head. “In
practice they may show themselves a little eccentric and
negleejay. But they have no need to look unusual on
principle. It’s only the politicians who need do it on
<span class="pageno" id="Page_113">113</span>principle. It’s only <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de rigueur</span></i>, as one might say, in the
political walks, Mr. Gumbril.”</p>
<p class="c010">“You surprise me,” said Gumbril. “I should have
thought that it was to the politician’s interest to look
respectable and normal.”</p>
<p class="c010">“But it is still more to his interest as a leader of men to
look distinguished,” Mr. Bojanus replied. “Well, not
precisely distinguished,” he corrected himself, “because
that implies that politicians look <em>distangay</em>, which I regret
to say, Mr. Gumbril, they very often don’t. Distinguishable,
is more what I mean.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Eccentricity is their badge of office?” suggested
Gumbril. He sat down luxuriously on the Patent Small-Clothes.</p>
<p class="c010">“That’s more like it,” said Mr. Bojanus, tilting his
moustaches. “The leader has got to look different from
the other ones. In the good old days they always wore
their official badges. The leader ’ad his livery, like every
one else, to show who he was. That was sensible, Mr.
Gumbril. Nowadays he has no badge—at least not for
ordinary occasions—for I don’t count Privy Councillors’
uniforms and all that sort of once-a-year fancy dress. ’E’s
reduced to dressing in some eccentric way or making the
most of the peculiarities of ’is personal appearance. A very
’apazard method of doing things, Mr. Gumbril, very
’apazard.”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril agreed.</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Bojanus went on, making small, neat gestures as he
spoke. “Some of them,” he said, “wear ’uge collars, like
Mr. Gladstone. Some wear orchids and eyeglasses, like
Joe Chamberlain. Some let their ’air grow, like Lloyd
George. Some wear curious ’ats, like Winston Churchill.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_114">114</span>Some put on black shirts, like this Mussolini, and some
put on red ones, like Garibaldi. Some turn up their moustaches,
like the German Emperor. Some turn them down,
like Clemenceau. Some grow whiskers, like Tirpitz. I
don’t speak of all the uniforms, orders, ornaments, ’ead-dresses,
feathers, crowns, buttons, tattooings, ear-rings,
sashes, swords, trains, tiaras, urims, thummims and what
not, Mr. Gumbril, that ’ave been used in the past and in
other parts of the world to distinguish the leader. We,
’oo know our ’istory, Mr. Gumbril, we know all about
that.”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril made a deprecating gesture. “You speak for
yourself, Mr. Bojanus,” he said.</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Bojanus bowed.</p>
<p class="c010">“Pray continue,” said Gumbril.</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Bojanus bowed again. “Well, Mr. Gumbril,” he
said, “the point of all these things, as I’ve already remarked,
is to make the leader look different, so that ’e can be recognized
at the first <em>coop d’oil</em>, as you might say, by the ’erd
’e ’appens to be leading. For the ’uman ’erd, Mr. Gumbril,
is an ’erd which can’t do without a leader. Sheep, for
example: I never noticed that they ’ad a leader; nor rooks.
Bees, on the other ’and, I take it, ’ave. At least when
they’re swarming. Correct me, Mr. Gumbril, if I’m
wrong. Natural ’istory was never, as you might say, my
<em>forty</em>.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Nor mine,” protested Gumbril.</p>
<p class="c010">“As for elephants and wolves, Mr. Gumbril, I can’t
pretend to speak of them with first-’and knowledge. Nor
llamas, nor locusts, nor squab pigeons, nor lemmings. But
’uman beings, Mr. Gumbril, those I can claim to talk of
with authority, if I may say so in all modesty, and not as
<span class="pageno" id="Page_115">115</span>the scribes. I ’ave made a special study of them, Mr.
Gumbril. And my profession ’as brought me into contact
with very numerous specimens.”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril could not help wondering where precisely in
Mr. Bojanus’s museum he himself had his place.</p>
<p class="c010">“The ’uman ’erd,” Mr. Bojanus went on, “must have a
leader. And a leader must have something to distinguish
him from the ’erd. It’s important for ’is interests that he
should be recognized easily. See a baby reaching out of a
bath and you immediately think of Pears’ Soap; see the
white ’air waving out behind and think of Lloyd George.
That’s the secret. But in my opinion, Mr. Gumbril, the
old system was much more sensible, give them regular
uniforms and badges, I say; make Cabinet Ministers wear
feathers in their ’air. Then the people will be looking to
a real fixed symbol of leadership, not to the peculiarities
of the mere individuals. Beards and ’air and funny collars
change; but a good uniform is always the same. Give
them feathers, that’s what I say, Mr. Gumbril. Feathers
will increase the dignity of the State and lessen the importance
of the individual. And that,” concluded Mr.
Bojanus with emphasis, “that, Mr. Gumbril, will be all
to the good.”</p>
<p class="c010">“But you don’t mean to tell me,” said Gumbril, “that
if I chose to show myself to the multitude in my inflated
trousers, I could become a leader—do you?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Ah, no,” said Mr. Bojanus. “You’d ’ave to ’ave the
talent for talking and ordering people about, to begin
with. Feathers wouldn’t give the genius, but they’d
magnify the effect of what there was.”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril got up and began to divest himself of the Small-Clothes.
He unscrewed the valve and the air whistled out,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_116">116</span>dyingly. He too sighed. “Curious,” he said pensively,
“that I’ve never felt the need for a leader. I’ve never
met any one I felt I could whole-heartedly admire or believe
in, never any one I wanted to follow. It must be pleasant,
I should think, to hand oneself over to somebody else.
It must give you a warm, splendid, comfortable feeling.”</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Bojanus smiled and shook his head. “You and I,
Mr. Gumbril,” he said, “we’re not the sort of people to be
impressed with feathers or even by talking and ordering
about. We may not be leaders ourselves. But at any rate
we aren’t the ’erd.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Not the main herd, perhaps.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Not any ’erd,” Mr. Bojanus insisted proudly.</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril shook his head dubiously and buttoned up his
trousers. He was not sure, now he came to think of it,
that he didn’t belong to all the herds—by a sort of honorary
membership and temporarily, as occasion offered, as one
belongs to the Union at the sister university or to the Naval
and Military Club while one’s own is having its annual
clean-out. Shearwater’s herd, Lypiatt’s herd, Mr. Mercaptan’s
herd, Mrs. Viveash’s herd, the architectural herd
of his father, the educational herd (but that, thank God!
was now bleating on distant pastures), the herd of Mr.
Bojanus—he belonged to them all a little, to none of them
completely. Nobody belonged to his herd. How could
they? No chameleon can live with comfort on a tartan.
He put on his coat.</p>
<p class="c010">“I’ll send the garments this evening,” said Mr. Bojanus.
Gumbril left the shop. At the theatrical wig-maker’s
in Leicester Square he ordered a blond fan-shaped beard to
match his own hair and moustache. He would, at any
rate, be his own leader; he would wear a badge, a symbol
<span class="pageno" id="Page_117">117</span>of authority. And Coleman had said that there were
dangerous relations to be entered into by the symbol’s
aid.</p>
<p class="c010">Ah, now he was provisionally a member of Coleman’s
herd. It was all very depressing.</p>
<div class="chapter">
<span class="pageno" id="Page_118">118</span>
<h2 class="c008">CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>
<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c009">Fan-shaped, blond, mounted on gauze and guaranteed
undetectable, it arrived from the wig-maker,
preciously packed in a stout cardboard box
six times too large for it and accompanied by a quarter of
a pint of the choicest spirit gum. In the privacy of his
bedroom Gumbril uncoffined it, held it out for his own
admiration, caressed its silkiness and finally tried it on,
holding it provisionally to his chin, in front of the looking-glass.
The effect, he decided immediately, was stunning,
was grandiose. From melancholy and all too mild he saw
himself transformed on the instant into a sort of jovial
Henry the Eighth, into a massive Rabelaisian man, broad
and powerful and exuberant with vitality and hair.</p>
<p class="c010">The proportions of his face were startlingly altered.
The podium, below the mouth, had been insufficiently
massive to carry the stately order of the nose; and the
ratiocinative attic of the forehead, noble enough, no doubt,
in itself, had been disproportionately high. The beard
now supplied the deficiencies in the stylobate, and planted
now on a firm basement of will, the order of the senses,
the aerial attic of ideas, reared themselves with a more
classical harmoniousness of proportion. It only remained
for him to order from Mr. Bojanus an American coat,
padded out at the shoulders as squarely and heroically as
a doublet of the Cinquecento, and he would look the
complete Rabelaisian man. Great eater, deep drinker,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_119">119</span>stout fighter, prodigious lover; clear thinker, creator of
beauty, seeker of truth and prophet of heroic grandeurs.
Fitted out with coat and beard, he could qualify for the
next vacancy among the cœnobites of Thelema.</p>
<p class="c010">He removed his beard—“put his beaver up,” as they
used to say in the fine old days of chivalry; he would have
to remember that little joke for Coleman’s benefit. He
put his beaver up—ha, ha!—and stared ruefully at the far
from Rabelaisian figure which now confronted him. The
moustache—that was genuine enough—which had looked,
in conjunction with the splendid work of art below, so
fierce and manly, served by itself, he now perceived, only
droopily to emphasize his native mildness and melancholy.</p>
<p class="c010">It was a dismal affair, which might have belonged to
Maurice Barrès in youth; a slanting, flagging, sagging
thing, such as could only grow on the lip of an assiduous
Cultivator of the Me, and would become, as one grew older,
ludicrously out of place on the visage of a roaring Nationalist.
If it weren’t that it fitted in so splendidly with the beard,
if it weren’t that it became so marvellously different in the
new context he had now discovered for it, he would have
shaved it off then and there.</p>
<p class="c010">Mournful appendage. But now he would transform it,
he would add to it its better half. Zadig’s quatrain to his
mistress, when the tablet on which it was written was
broken in two, became a treasonable libel on the king. So
this moustache, thought Gumbril, as gingerly he applied
the spirit gum to his cheeks and chin, this moustache which
by itself serves only to betray me, becomes, as soon as it is
joined to its missing context, an amorous arm for the
conquest of the fair sex.</p>
<p class="c010">A little far-fetched, he decided; a little ponderous.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_120">120</span>And besides, as so few people had read Zadig, not much
use in conversation. Cautiously and with neat, meticulous
finger-tips he adjusted the transformation to his gummed
face, pressed it firmly, held it while it stuck fast. The
portals of Thelema opened before him; he was free of
those rich orchards, those halls and courts, those broad
staircases winding in noble spirals within the flanks of each
of the fair round towers. And it was Coleman who had
pointed out the way; he felt duly grateful. One last look
at the Complete Man, one final and definitive constatation
that the Mild and Melancholy one was, for the time at
least, no more; and he was ready in all confidence to set
out. He selected a loose, light great-coat—not that he
needed a coat at all, for the day was bright and warm; but
until Mr. Bojanus had done his labour of padding he would
have to broaden himself out in this way, even if it did mean
that he might be uncomfortably hot. To fall short of
Complete Manhood for fear of a little inconvenience would
be absurd. He slipped, therefore, into his light coat—a
toga, Mr. Bojanus called it, a very neat toga in real West
Country whipcord. He put on his broadest and blackest
felt hat, for breadth above everything was what he needed
to give him completeness, breadth of stature, breadth of
mind, breadth of human sympathy, breadth of smile,
breadth of humour, breadth of everything. The final
touch was a massive and antique Malacca cane belonging
to his father. If he had possessed a bulldog, he would have
taken it out on a leash. But he did not. He issued into
the sunshine, unaccompanied.</p>
<p class="c010">But unaccompanied he did not mean to remain for long.
These warm, bright May days were wonderful days for
being in love on. And to be alone on such days was like
<span class="pageno" id="Page_121">121</span>a malady. It was a malady from which the Mild and
Melancholy Man suffered all too frequently. And yet there
were millions of superfluous women in the country; millions
of them. Every day, in the streets, one saw thousands of
them passing; and some were exquisite, were ravishing,
the only possible soul-mates. Thousands of unique soul-mates
every day. The Mild and Melancholy one allowed
them to pass—for ever. But to-day—to-day he was the
complete and Rabelaisian man; he was bearded to the
teeth; the imbecile game was at its height; there would
be opportunities, and the Complete Man could know how
to take them. No, he would not be unaccompanied for long.</p>
<p class="c010">Outside in the square the fourteen plane trees glowed in
their young, unsullied green. At the end of every street
the golden muslin of the haze hung in an unwrinkled curtain
that thinned away above the sky’s gauzy horizon to transparent
nothing against the intenser blue. The dim, conch-like
murmur that in a city is silence seemed hazily to identify
itself with the golden mistiness of summer, and against this
dim, wide background the yells of the playing children
detached themselves, distinct and piercing. “Beaver”
they shouted, “beaver!” and, “Is it cold up there?”
Full of playful menace, the Complete Man shook at them
his borrowed Malacca. He accepted their prompt hail as
the most favourable of omens.</p>
<p class="c010">At the first tobacconist’s Gumbril bought the longest
cigar he could find, and trailing behind him expiring blue
wreaths of Cuban smoke, he made his way slowly and with
an ample swagger towards the Park. It was there, under
the elms, on the shores of the ornamental waters, that he
expected to find his opportunity, that he intended—how
confidently behind his Gargantuan mask!—to take it.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_122">122</span>The opportunity offered itself sooner than he expected.</p>
<p class="c010">He had just turned into the Queen’s Road and was
sauntering past Whiteley’s with the air of one who knows
that he has a right to a good place, to two or three good
places even, in the sun, when he noticed just in front of
him, peering intently at the New Season’s Models, a young
woman whom in his mild and melancholy days he would
have only hopelessly admired, but who now, to the Complete
Man, seemed a destined and accessible prey. She was fairly
tall, but seemed taller than she actually was, by reason of
her remarkable slenderness. Not that she looked disagreeably
thin, far from it. It was a rounded slenderness.
The Complete Man decided to consider her as tubular—flexible
and tubular, like a section of boa constrictor, should
one say. She was dressed in clothes that emphasized this
serpentine slimness, in a close-fitting grey jacket that
buttoned up to the neck and a long, narrow grey skirt that
came down to her ankles. On her head was a small, sleek
black hat, that looked almost as though it were made of
metal. It was trimmed on one side with a bunch of dull
golden foliage.</p>
<p class="c010">Those golden leaves were the only touch of ornament in
all the severe smoothness and unbroken tubularity of her
person. As for her face, that was neither strictly beautiful
nor strictly ugly, but combined elements of both beauty
and ugliness into a whole that was unexpected, that was
oddly and somehow unnaturally attractive.</p>
<p class="c010">Pretending, he too, to take an interest in the New Season’s
Models, Gumbril made, squinting sideways over the burning
tip of his cigar, an inventory of her features. The forehead,
that was mostly hidden by her hat; it might be
pensively and serenely high, it might be of that degree of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_123">123</span>lowness which in men is villainous, but in women is only
another—a rather rustic one perhaps, rather <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">canaille</span></i> even,
but definitely another—attraction. There was no telling.
As for her eyes, they were green, and limpid; set wide
apart in her head they looked out from under heavy lids
and through openings that slanted up towards the outer
corners. Her nose was slightly aquiline. Her mouth
was full-lipped, but straight and unexpectedly wide. Her
chin was small, round and firm. She had a pale skin, a
little flushed over the cheek-bones, which were prominent.</p>
<p class="c010">On the left cheek, close under the corner of the slanting
eye, she had a brown mole. Such hair as Gumbril could
see beneath her hat was pale and inconspicuously blond.
When she had finished looking at the New Season’s Models
she moved slowly on, halting for a moment before the
travelling trunks and the fitted picnic baskets; dwelling
for a full minute over the corsets, passing the hats, for some
reason, rather contemptuously, but pausing, which seemed
strange, for a long pensive look at the cigars and wine. As
for the tennis rackets and cricket bats, the school outfits
and the gentleman’s hosiery—she hadn’t so much as a look
for one of them. But how lovingly she lingered before
the boots and shoes! Her own feet, the Complete Man
noticed with satisfaction, had an elegance of florid curves.
And while other folk walked on neat’s leather she was
content to be shod with nothing coarser than mottled
serpent’s skin.</p>
<p class="c010">Slowly they drifted up Queen’s Road, lingering before
every jeweller’s, every antiquarian’s, every milliner’s on
the way. The stranger gave him no opportunity, and
indeed, Gumbril reflected, how should she? For the
imbecile game on which he was relying is a travelling piquet
<span class="pageno" id="Page_124">124</span>for two players, not a game of patience. No sane human
being could play it in solitude. He would have to make the
opportunity himself.</p>
<p class="c010">All that was mild in him, all that was melancholy, shrank
with a sickened reluctance from the task of breaking—with
what consequences delicious and perilous in the future or,
in the case of the deserved snub, immediately humiliating?—a
silence which, by the tenth or twelfth shop window,
had become quite unbearably significant. The Mild and
Melancholy one would have drifted to the top of the road,
sharing, with that community of tastes which is the basis
of every happy union, her enthusiasm for brass candlesticks
and toasting-forks, imitation Chippendale furniture, gold
watch-bracelets and low-waisted summer frocks; would
have drifted to the top of the road and watched her, dumbly,
disappearing for ever into the green Park or along the blank
pavements of the Bayswater Road; would have watched
her for ever disappear and then, if the pubs had happened
to be open, would have gone and ordered a glass of port,
and sitting at the bar would have savoured, still dumbly,
among the other drinkers, the muddy grapes of the Douro,
and his own unique loneliness.</p>
<p class="c010">That was what the Mild and Melancholy one would have
done. But the sight, as he gazed earnestly into an antiquary’s
window, of his own powerful bearded face reflected
in a sham Heppelwhite mirror, reminded him that the Mild
and Melancholy one was temporarily extinct, and that it
was the Complete Man who now dawdled, smoking his long
cigar, up the Queen’s Road towards the Abbey of Thelema.</p>
<p class="c010">He squared his shoulders; in that loose toga of Mr.
Bojanus’s he looked as copious as François Premier. The
time, he decided, had come.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_125">125</span>It was at this moment that the reflection of the stranger’s
face joined itself in the little mirror, as she made a little
movement away from the Old Welsh dresser in the corner,
to that of his own. She looked at the spurious Heppelwhite.
Their eyes met in the hospitable glass. Gumbril
smiled. The corners of the stranger’s wide mouth seemed
faintly to move; like petals of the magnolia, her eyelids
came slowly down over her slanting eyes. Gumbril turned
from the reflection to the reality.</p>
<p class="c010">“If you want to say Beaver,” he said, “you may.”</p>
<p class="c010">The Complete Man had made his first speech.</p>
<p class="c010">“I want to say nothing,” said the stranger. She spoke
with a charming precision and distinctness, lingering with
a pretty emphasis on the <em>n</em> of nothing. “N—n—nothing”—it
sounded rather final. She turned away, she moved
on.</p>
<p class="c010">But the Complete Man was not one to be put off by a
mere ultimatum. “There,” he said, falling into step with
her, “now I’ve had it—the deserved snub. Honour is
saved, prestige duly upheld. Now we can get on with our
conversation.”</p>
<p class="c010">The Mild and Melancholy one stood by, gasping with
astonished admiration.</p>
<p class="c010">“You are v—very impertinent,” said the stranger,
smiling and looking up from under the magnolia petals.</p>
<p class="c010">“It is in my character,” said the Complete Man.
“You mustn’t blame me. One cannot escape from one’s
heredity; that’s one’s share of original sin.”</p>
<p class="c010">“There is always grace,” said the stranger.</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril caressed his beard. “True,” he replied.</p>
<p class="c010">“I advise you to pr—ray for it.”</p>
<p class="c010">His prayer, the Mild and Melancholy one reflected, had
<span class="pageno" id="Page_126">126</span>already been answered. The original sin in him had been
self-corrected.</p>
<p class="c010">“Here is another antique shop,” said Gumbril. “Shall
we stop and have a look at it?”</p>
<p class="c010">The stranger glanced at him doubtfully. But he looked
quite serious. They stopped.</p>
<p class="c010">“How revolting this sham cottage furniture is,” Gumbril
remarked. The shop, he noticed, was called ‘Ye Olde
Farme House.’</p>
<p class="c010">The stranger, who had been on the point of saying how
much she liked those lovely Old Welsh dressers, gave him
her heartiest agreement. “So v—vulgar.”</p>
<p class="c010">“So horribly refined. So refined and artistic.”</p>
<p class="c010">She laughed on a descending chromatic scale. This was
excitingly new. Poor Aunt Aggie with her Arts and
Crafts, and her old English furniture. And to think she
had taken them so seriously! She saw in a flash the
fastidious lady that she now was—with Louis whatever-it-was
furniture at home, and jewels, and young poets to tea,
and real artists. In the past, when she had imagined herself
entertaining real artists, it had always been among really
artistic furniture. Aunt Aggie’s furniture. But now—no,
oh no. This man was probably an artist. His beard;
and that big black hat. But not poor; very well dressed.</p>
<p class="c010">“Yes, it’s funny to think that there are people who call
that sort of thing artistic. One’s quite s—sorry for them,”
she added, with a little hiss.</p>
<p class="c010">“You have a kind heart,” said Gumbril. “I’m glad to
see that.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Not v—very kind, I’m af—fraid.” She looked at him
sideways, and significantly as the fastidious lady would have
looked at one of the poets.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_127">127</span>“Well, kind enough, I hope,” said the Complete Man.
He was delighted with his new acquaintance.</p>
<p class="c010">Together they disembogued into the Bayswater Road.
It was here, Gumbril reflected, that the Mild and Melancholy
one would dumbly have slunk away to his glass of
port and his loneliness among the alien topers at the bar.
But the Complete Man took his new friend by the elbow,
and steered her into the traffic. Together they crossed
the road, together entered the park.</p>
<p class="c010">“I still think you are v—very impertinent,” said the lady.
“What induced you to follow me?”</p>
<p class="c010">With a single comprehensive gesture, Gumbril indicated
the sun, the sky, the green trees airily glittering, the grass,
the emerald lights and violet shadows of the rustic distance.
“On a day like this,” he said, “how could I help it?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Original sin?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Oh,” the Complete Man modestly shook his head, “I
lay no claim to originality in this.”</p>
<p class="c010">The stranger laughed. This was nearly as good as a young
poet at the tea-table. She was very glad that she’d decided,
after all, to put on her best suit this afternoon, even if it
was a little stuffy for the warmth of the day. He, too, she
noticed, was wearing a great-coat; which seemed rather
odd.</p>
<p class="c010">“Is it original,” he went on, “to go and tumble stupidly
like an elephant into a pitfall, head over ears, at first
sight...?”</p>
<p class="c010">She looked at him sideways, then closed down the magnolia
petals, and smiled. This was going to be the real thing—one
of those long, those interminable, or, at any rate,
indefinitely renewable conversations about love; witty,
subtle, penetrating and bold, like the conversations in
<span class="pageno" id="Page_128">128</span>books, like the conversations across the tea-table between
brilliant young poets and ladies of quality, grown fastidious
through an excessive experience, fastidious and a little
weary, but still, in their subtle way, insatiably curious.</p>
<p class="c010">“Suppose we sit down,” suggested Gumbril, and he
pointed to a couple of green iron chairs, standing isolated
in the middle of the grass close together and with their
fronts slanting inwards a little towards one another in a
position that suggested a confidential intimacy. At the
prospect of the conversation that, inevitably, was about to
unroll itself, he felt decidedly less elated than did his new
friend. If there was anything he disliked it was conversations
about love. It bored him, oh, it bored him most
horribly, this minute analysis of the passion that young
women always seemed to expect one, at some point or other
in one’s relation with them, to make. How love alters
the character for both good and bad; how physical passion
need not be incompatible with the spiritual; how a hateful
and tyrannous possessiveness can be allied in love with the
most unselfish solicitude for the other party—oh, he knew
all this and much more, so well, so well. And whether
one can be in love with more than one person at a time,
whether love can exist without jealousy, whether pity,
affection, desire can in any way replace the full and genuine
passion—how often he had had to thrash out these dreary
questions!</p>
<p class="c010">And all the philosophic speculations were equally familiar,
all the physiological and anthropological and psychological
facts. In the theory of the subject he had ceased to take
any interest. Unhappily, a discussion of the theory always
seemed to be an essential preliminary to the practice of it.
He sighed a little wearily as he took his seat on the green
<span class="pageno" id="Page_129">129</span>iron chair. But then, recollecting that he was now the
Complete Man, and that the Complete Man must do everything
with a flourish and a high hand, he leaned forward
and, smiling with a charming insolence through his beard,
began:</p>
<p class="c010">“Tiresias, you may remember, was granted the singular
privilege of living both as a man and a woman.”</p>
<p class="c010">Ah, this was the genuine young poet. Supporting an
elbow on the back of her chair and leaning her cheek against
her hand, she disposed herself to listen and, where necessary,
brilliantly to interpellate; it was through half-closed eyes
that she looked at him, and she smiled faintly in a manner
which she knew, from experience, to be enigmatic, and
though a shade haughty, though a tiny bit mocking and
ironical, exceedingly attractive.</p>
<p class="c010">An hour and a half later they were driving towards an
address in Bloxam Gardens, Maida Vale. The name
seemed vaguely familiar to Gumbril. Bloxam Gardens—perhaps
one of his aunts had lived there once?</p>
<p class="c010">“It’s a dr—dreadful little maisonnette,” she explained.
“Full of awful things. We had to take it furnished. It’s
so impossible to find anything now.”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril leaned back in his corner, wondering, as he studied
that averted profile, who or what this young woman could
be. She seemed to be in the obvious movement, to like
the sort of things one would expect people to like; she
seemed to be as highly civilized, in Mr. Mercaptan’s rather
technical sense of the term, as free of all prejudices as the
great exponent of civilization himself.</p>
<p class="c010">She seemed, from her coolly dropped hints, to possess
all the dangerous experience, all the assurance and easy
ruthlessness of a great lady whose whole life is occupied
<span class="pageno" id="Page_130">130</span>in the interminable affairs of the heart, the senses and the
head. But, by a strange contradiction she seemed to find
her life narrow and uninteresting. She had complained
in so many words that her husband misunderstood and
neglected her, had complained, by implication, that she
knew very few interesting people.</p>
<p class="c010">The maisonnette in Bloxam Gardens was certainly not
very splendid—six rooms on the second and third floors of
a peeling stucco house. And the furniture—decidedly
Hire Purchase. And the curtains and cretonnes—brightly
‘modern,’ positively ‘futurist.’</p>
<p class="c010">“What one has to put up with in furnished flats!”
The lady made a grimace as she ushered him into the
sitting-room. And while she spoke the words, she really
managed to persuade herself that the furniture wasn’t
theirs, that they had found all this sordid stuff cluttering
up the rooms, not chosen it, oh with pains! themselves,
not doggedly paid for it, month by month.</p>
<p class="c010">“Our own things,” she murmured vaguely, “are stored.
In the Riviera.” It was there, under the palms, among the
gaudy melon flowers and the croupiers that the fastidious
lady had last held her salon of young poets. In the Riviera—that
would explain, now she came to think of it, a lot of
things, if explanation ever became necessary.</p>
<p class="c010">The Complete Man nodded sympathetically. “Other
people’s tastes,” he held up his hands, they both laughed.
“But why do we think of other people?” he added. And
coming forward with a conquering impulsiveness he took
both her long, fine hands in his and raised them to his
bearded mouth.</p>
<p class="c010">She looked at him for a second, then dropped her eyelids,
took back her hands. “I must go and make the tea,” she
<span class="pageno" id="Page_131">131</span>said. “The servants”—the plural was a pardonable
exaggeration—“are out.”</p>
<p class="c010">Gallantly, the Complete Man offered to come and help
her. These scenes of intimate life had a charm all their
own. But she would not allow it. “No, no,” she was
very firm, “I simply forbid you. You must stay here.
I won’t be a moment,” and she was gone, closing the door
carefully behind her.</p>
<p class="c010">Left to himself, Gumbril sat down and filed his nails.</p>
<p class="c010">As for the young lady, she hurried along to her dingy
little kitchen, lit the gas, put the kettle on, set out the
teapot and the cups on a tray, and from the biscuit-box,
where it was stored, took out the remains of a chocolate
cake, which had already seen service at the day-before-yesterday’s
tea-party. When all was ready here, she tiptoed
across to her bedroom and sitting down at her dressing-table,
began with hands that trembled a little with excitement
to powder her nose, and heighten the colour of her
cheeks. Even after the last touch had been given, she still
sat there, looking at her image in the glass.</p>
<p class="c010">The lady and the poet, she was thinking, the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grande dame</span></i>
and the brilliant young man of genius. She liked young
men with beards. But he was not an artist, in spite of the
beard, in spite of the hat. He was a writer of sorts. So
she gathered; but he was reticent, he was delightfully
mysterious. She too, for that matter. The great lady
slips out, masked, into the street; touches the young man’s
sleeve: Come with me. She chooses, does not let herself
passively be chosen. The young poet falls at her feet;
she lifts him up. One is accustomed to this sort of
thing.</p>
<p class="c010">She opened her jewel box, took out all her rings—there
<span class="pageno" id="Page_132">132</span>were not many of them, alas!—and put them on. Two or
three of them, on second thoughts, she took off again; they
were a little, she suspected with a sudden qualm, in other
people’s taste.</p>
<p class="c010">He was very clever, very artistic—only that seemed to
be the wrong word to use; he seemed to know all the new
things, all the interesting people. Perhaps he would introduce
her to some of them. And he was so much at ease
behind his knowledge, so well assured. But for her part,
she felt pretty certain, she had made no stupid mistakes.
She too had been, had looked at any rate—which was the
important thing—very much at ease.</p>
<p class="c010">She liked young men with beards. They looked so
Russian. Catherine of Russia had been one of the great
ladies with caprices. Masked in the streets. Young
poet, come with me. Or even, Young butcher’s boy.
But that, no, that was going too far, too low. Still, life,
life—it was there to be lived—life—to be enjoyed. And
now, and now? She was still wondering what would
happen next, when the kettle, which was one of those funny
ones which whistle when they come to the boil, began,
fitfully, at first, then, under full steam, unflaggingly, to
sound its mournful, other-worldly note. She sighed and
bestirred herself to attend to it.</p>
<p class="c010">“Let me help you.” Gumbril jumped up as she came
into the room. “What can I do?” He hovered rather
ineptly round her.</p>
<p class="c010">The lady put down her tray on the little table.
“N—nothing,” she said.</p>
<p class="c010">“N—nothing?” he imitated her with a playful mockery.
“Am I good for n—nothing at all?” He took one of her
hands and kissed it.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_133">133</span>“Nothing that’s of the l—least importance.” She sat
down and began to pour out the tea.</p>
<p class="c010">The Complete Man also sat down. “So to adore at
first sight,” he asked, “is not of the l—least importance?”</p>
<p class="c010">She shook her head, smiled, raised and lowered her eyelids.
One was so well accustomed to this sort of thing;
it had no importance. “Sugar?” she asked. The young
poet was safely there, sparkling across the tea-table. He
offered love and she, with the easy heartlessness of one who
is so well accustomed to this sort of thing, offered him sugar.</p>
<p class="c010">He nodded. “Please. But if it’s of no importance to
you,” he went on, “then I’ll go away at once.”</p>
<p class="c010">The lady laughed her section of a descending chromatic
scale. “Oh no, you won’t,” she said. “You can’t.”
And she felt that the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grande dame</span></i> had made a very fine
stroke.</p>
<p class="c010">“Quite right,” the Complete Man replied; “I couldn’t.”
He stirred his tea. “But who are you,” he looked up at
her suddenly, “you devilish female?” He was genuinely
anxious to know; and besides, he was paying her a very
pretty compliment. “What do you do with your dangerous
existence?”</p>
<p class="c010">“I enjoy life,” she said. “I think one ought to enjoy
life. Don’t you? I think it’s one’s first duty.” She
became quite grave. “One ought to enjoy every moment
of it,” she said. “Oh, passionately, adventurously, newly,
excitingly, uniquely.”</p>
<p class="c010">The Complete Man laughed. “A conscientious hedonist.
I see.”</p>
<p class="c010">She felt uncomfortably that the fastidious lady had not
quite lived up to her character. She had spoken more like
a young woman who finds life too dull and daily, and would
<span class="pageno" id="Page_134">134</span>like to get on to the cinema. “I am very conscientious,”
she said, making significant play with the magnolia petals
and smiling her riddling smile. She must retrieve the
Great Catherine’s reputation.</p>
<p class="c010">“I could see that from the first,” mocked the Complete
Man with a triumphant insolence. “Conscience doth
make cowards of us all.”</p>
<p class="c010">The fastidious lady only contemptuously smiled. “Have
a little chocolate cake,” she suggested. Her heart was
beating. She wondered, she wondered.</p>
<p class="c010">There was a long silence. Gumbril finished his chocolate
cake, gloomily drank his tea and did not speak. He found,
all at once, that he had nothing to say. His jovial confidence
seemed, for the moment, to have deserted him. He was
only the Mild and Melancholy one foolishly disguised as a
Complete Man; a sheep in beaver’s clothing. He entrenched
himself behind his formidable silence and waited;
waited, at first, sitting in his chair, then, when this
total inactivity became unbearable, striding about the
room.</p>
<p class="c010">She looked at him, for all her air of serene composure,
with a certain disquiet. What on earth was he up to now?
What could he be thinking about? Frowning like that,
he looked like a young Jupiter, bearded and burly (though
not, she noticed, quite so burly as he had appeared in his
overcoat) making ready to throw a thunderbolt. Perhaps
he was thinking of her—suspecting her, seeing through the
fastidious lady and feeling angry at her attempted deception.
Or perhaps he was bored with her, perhaps he was
wanting to go away. Well, let him go; she didn’t mind.
Or perhaps he was just made like that—a moody young
poet; that seemed, on the whole, the most likely explanation;
<span class="pageno" id="Page_135">135</span>it was also the most pleasing and romantic. She
waited. They both waited.</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril looked at her and was put to shame by the
spectacle of her quiet serenity. He must do something, he
told himself; he must recover the Complete Man’s lost
<em>morale</em>. Desperately he came to a halt in front of the one
decent picture hanging on the walls. It was an eighteenth-century
engraving of Raphael’s ‘Transfiguration’—better,
he always thought, in black and white than in its bleakly-coloured
original.</p>
<p class="c010">“That’s a nice engraving,” he said. “Very nice.”
The mere fact of having uttered at all was a great comfort
to him, a real relief.</p>
<p class="c010">“Yes,” she said, “That belongs to me. I found it in
a second-hand shop, not far from here.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Photography,” he pronounced, with that temporary
earnestness which made him seem an enthusiast about
everything, “is a mixed blessing. It has made it possible
to reproduce pictures so easily and cheaply, that all the
bad artists who were well occupied in the past, making
engravings of good men’s paintings, are now free to do bad
original work of their own.” All this was terribly impersonal,
he told himself, terribly off the point. He was
losing ground. He must do something drastic to win it
back. But what?</p>
<p class="c010">She came to his rescue. “I bought another at the same
time,” she said. “‘The Last Communion of St. Jerome,’
by—who is it? I forget.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Ah, you mean Domenichino’s ‘St. Jerome’?” The
Complete Man was afloat again. “Poussin’s favourite
picture. Mine too, very nearly. I’d like to see that.”</p>
<p class="c010">“It’s in my room, I’m afraid. But if you don’t mind.”</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_136">136</span>He bowed. “If <em>you</em> don’t.”</p>
<p class="c010">She smiled graciously to him and got up. “This way,”
she said, and opened the door.</p>
<p class="c010">“It’s a lovely picture,” Gumbril went on, loquaciously
now, behind her, as they walked down the dark corridor.
“And besides, I have a sentimental attachment to it.
There used to be a copy of an engraving of it at home, when
I was a child. And I remember wondering and wondering—oh,
it went on for years—every time I saw the picture;
wondering why on earth that old bishop (for I did know
it was a bishop) should be handing the naked old man a
five-shilling piece.”</p>
<p class="c010">She opened a door; they were in her very pink room.
Grave in its solemn and subtly harmonious beauty, the
picture hung over the mantelpiece, hung there, among the
photographs of the little friends of her own age, like some
strange object from another world. From within that
chipped gilt frame all the beauty, all the grandeur of religion
looked darkly out upon the pink room. The little friends
of her own age, all deliciously nubile, sweetly smiled, turned
up their eyes, clasped Persian cats or stood jauntily, feet
apart, hand in the breeches pocket of the land-girl’s uniform;
the pink roses on the wallpaper, the pink and white
curtains, the pink bed, the strawberry-coloured carpet,
filled all the air with the rosy reflections of nakedness and
life.</p>
<p class="c010">And utterly remote, absorbed in their grave, solemn
ecstasy, the robed and mitred priest held out, the dying
saint yearningly received, the body of the Son of God.
The ministrants looked gravely on, the little angels looped
in the air above a gravely triumphant festoon, the lion
slept at the saint’s feet, and through the arch beyond, the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_137">137</span>eye travelled out over a quiet country of dark trees and
hills.</p>
<p class="c010">“There it is,” she waved towards the mantelpiece.</p>
<p class="c010">But Gumbril had taken it all in long ago. “You see
what I mean by the five-shilling piece.” And stepping up
to the picture, he pointed to the round bright wafer which
the priest holds in his hand and whose averted disk is like
the essential sun at the centre of the picture’s harmonious
universe. “Those were the days of five-shilling pieces,”
he went on. “You’re probably too young to remember
those large, lovely things. They came my way occasionally,
and consecrated wafers didn’t. So you can understand
how much the picture puzzled me. A bishop giving a
naked old man five shillings in a church, with angels fluttering
overhead, and a lion sleeping in the foreground. It
was obscure, it was horribly obscure.” He turned away
from the picture and confronted his hostess, who was
standing a little way behind him smiling enigmatically
and invitingly.</p>
<p class="c010">“Obscure,” he repeated. “But so is everything. So is
life in general. And you,” he stepped towards her, “you
in particular.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Am I?” she lifted her limpid eyes at him. Oh, how
her heart was beating, how hard it was to be the fastidious
lady, calmly satisfying her caprice. How difficult it was to
be accustomed to this sort of thing. What was going to
happen next?</p>
<p class="c010">What happened next was that the Complete Man came
still closer, put his arms round her, as though he were
inviting her to the fox-trot, and began kissing her with a
startling violence. His beard tickled her neck; shivering
a little, she brought down the magnolia petals across her
<span class="pageno" id="Page_138">138</span>eyes. The Complete Man lifted her up, walked across the
room carrying the fastidious lady in his arms and deposited
her on the rosy catafalque of the bed. Lying there
with her eyes shut, she did her best to pretend she was
dead.</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril had looked at his wrist watch and found that it
was six o’clock. Already? He prepared himself to take
his departure. Wrapped in a pink kimono, she came out
into the hall to wish him farewell.</p>
<p class="c010">“When shall I see you again, Rosie?” He had learnt
that her name was Rosie.</p>
<p class="c010">She had recovered her great lady’s equanimity and detachment,
and was able to shrug her shoulders and smile.
“How should I know?” she asked, implying that she could
not foresee what her caprice might be an hour hence.</p>
<p class="c010">“May I write then, and ask one of these days if you do
know?”</p>
<p class="c010">She put her head on one side and raised her eyebrows,
doubtfully. At last nodded. “Yes, you can write,” she
permitted.</p>
<p class="c010">“Good,” said the Complete Man, and picked up his wide
hat. She held out her hand to him with stateliness, and
with a formal gallantry he kissed it. He was just closing
the front door behind him, when he remembered something.
He turned round. “I say,” he called after the
retreating pink kimono. “It’s rather absurd. But how
can I write? I don’t know your name. I can’t just
address it ‘Rosie’”</p>
<p class="c010">The great lady laughed delightedly. This had the
real <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">capriccio</span></i> flavour. “Wait,” she said, and she ran into
the sitting-room. She was back again in a moment with
an oblong of pasteboard. “There,” she said, and dropped
<span class="pageno" id="Page_139">139</span>it into his great-coat pocket. Then blowing a kiss she was
gone.</p>
<p class="c010">The Complete Man closed the door and descended the
stairs. Well, well, he said to himself; well, well. He
put his hand in his coat pocket and took out the card. In
the dim light of the staircase he read the name on it with
some difficulty. Mrs. James—but no, but no. He read
again, straining his eyes; there was no question of it.
Mrs. James Shearwater.</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. James Shearwater.</p>
<p class="c010">That was why he had vaguely known the name of Bloxam
Gardens.</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. James Shear——. Step after step he descended,
ponderously. “Good Lord,” he said out loud. “Good
Lord.”</p>
<p class="c010">But why had he never seen her? Why did Shearwater
never produce her? Now he came to think of it, he hardly
ever spoke of her.</p>
<p class="c010">Why had she said the flat wasn’t theirs? It was; he
had heard Shearwater talk about it.</p>
<p class="c010">Did she make a habit of this sort of thing!</p>
<p class="c010">Could Shearwater be wholly unaware of what she was
really like? But, for that matter, what <em>was</em> she really
like?</p>
<p class="c010">He was half-way down the last flight, when with a rattle
and a squeak of hinges the door of the house, which was
only separated by a short lobby from the foot of the stairs,
opened, revealing, on the doorstep, Shearwater and a
friend, eagerly talking.</p>
<p class="c010">“... I take my rabbit,” the friend was saying—he was
a young man with dark, protruding eyes, and staring, doggy
nostrils; very eager, lively and loud. “I take my rabbit
<span class="pageno" id="Page_140">140</span>and I inject into it the solution of eyes, pulped eyes of
another dead rabbit. You see?”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril’s first instinct was to rush up the stairs and hide
in the first likely-looking corner. But he pulled himself
together at once. He was a Complete Man, and Complete
Men do not hide; moreover, he was sufficiently disguised
to be quite unrecognizable. He stood where he was, and
listened to the conversation.</p>
<p class="c010">“The rabbit,” continued the young man, and with his
bright eyes and staring, sniffing nose, he looked like a
poacher’s terrier ready to go barking after the first white tail
that passed his way; “the rabbit naturally develops the
appropriate resistance, develops a specific anti-eye to protect
itself. I then take some of its anti-eye serum and inject
it into my female rabbit; I then immediately breed from
her.” He paused.</p>
<p class="c010">“Well?” asked Shearwater, in his slow, ponderous way.
He lifted his great round head inquiringly and looked at
the doggy young man from under his bushy eyebrows.</p>
<p class="c010">The doggy young man smiled triumphantly. “The
young ones,” he said, emphasizing his words by striking his
right fist against the extended palm of his left hand, “the
young ones are born with defective sight.”</p>
<p class="c010">Thoughtfully Shearwater pulled at his formidable
moustache. “H’m,” he said slowly. “Very remarkable.”</p>
<p class="c010">“You realize the full significance of it?” asked the young
man. “We seem to be effecting the germ-plasm directly.
We have found a way of making acquired characteristics....”</p>
<p class="c010">“Pardon me,” said Gumbril. He had decided that it
was time to be gone. He ran down the stairs and across
the tiled hall, he pushed his way firmly but politely between
the talkers.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_141">141</span>“... heritable,” continued the young man, imperturbably
eager, speaking through and over and round the
obstacle.</p>
<p class="c010">“Damn!” said Shearwater. The Complete Man had
trodden on his toe. “Sorry,” he added, absent-mindedly
apologizing for the injury he had received.</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril hurried off along the street. “If we really
have found out a technique for influencing the germ-plasm
directly ...” he heard the doggy young man saying; but
he was already too far away to catch the rest of the sentence.
There are many ways, he reflected, of spending an afternoon.</p>
<p class="c010">The doggy young man refused to come in, he had to get
in his game of tennis before dinner. Shearwater climbed
the stairs alone. He was taking off his hat in the little hall
of his own apartment, when Rosie came out of the sitting-room
with a trayful of tea-things.</p>
<p class="c010">“Well?” he asked, kissing her affectionately on the forehead.
“Well? People to tea?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Only one,” Rosie replied. “I’ll go and make you a
fresh cup.”</p>
<p class="c010">She glided off, rustling in her pink kimono towards the
kitchen.</p>
<p class="c010">Shearwater sat down in the sitting-room. He had
brought home with him from the library the fifteenth
volume of the <cite>Biochemical Journal</cite>. There was something
in it he wanted to look up. He turned over the pages.
Ah, here it was. He began reading. Rosie came back
again.</p>
<p class="c010">“Here’s your tea,” she said.</p>
<p class="c010">He thanked her without looking up. The tea grew cold
on the little table at his side.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_142">142</span>Lying on the sofa, Rosie pondered and remembered.
Had the events of the afternoon, she asked herself, really
happened? They seemed very improbable and remote,
now, in this studious silence. She couldn’t help feeling a
little disappointed. Was it only this? So simple and
obvious? She tried to work herself up into a more exalted
mood. She even tried to feel guilty; but there she failed
completely. She tried to feel rapturous; but without
much more success. Still, he certainly had been a most
extraordinary man. Such impudence, and at the same
time such delicacy and tact.</p>
<p class="c010">It was a pity she couldn’t afford to change the furniture.
She saw now that it wouldn’t do at all. She would go
and tell Aunt Aggie about the dreadful middle-classness of
her Art and Craftiness.</p>
<p class="c010">She ought to have an Empire <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chaise longue</span></i>. Like Madame
Récamier. She could see herself lying there, dispensing
tea. “Like a delicious pink snake.” He had called her
that.</p>
<p class="c010">Well, really, now she came to think of it all again, it had
been too queer, too queer.</p>
<p class="c010">“What’s a hedonist?” she suddenly asked.</p>
<p class="c010">Shearwater looked up from the <cite>Journal of Biochemistry</cite>.
“What?” he said.</p>
<p class="c010">“A hedonist.”</p>
<p class="c010">“A man who holds that the end of life is pleasure.”</p>
<p class="c010">A ‘conscientious hedonist’—ah, that was good.</p>
<p class="c010">“This tea is cold,” Shearwater remarked.</p>
<p class="c010">“You should have drunk it before,” she said. The
silence renewed and prolonged itself.</p>
<p class="c010">Rosie was getting much better, Shearwater reflected, as
he washed his hands before supper, about not interrupting
<span class="pageno" id="Page_143">143</span>him when he was busy. This evening she had really not
disturbed him at all, or at most only once, and that not
seriously. There had been times in the past when the
child had really made life almost impossible. There were
those months at the beginning of their married life, when
she had thought she would like to study physiology herself
and be a help to him. He remembered the hours he had
spent trying to teach her elementary facts about the
chromosomes. It had been a great relief when she abandoned
the attempt. He had suggested she should go in for
stencilling patterns on Government linen. Such pretty
curtains and things one could make like that. But she
hadn’t taken very kindly to the idea. There had followed
a long period when she seemed to have nothing to do but
prevent him from doing anything. Ringing him up at the
laboratory, invading his study, sitting on his knee, or
throwing her arms round his neck, or pulling his hair,
or asking ridiculous questions when he was trying to
work.</p>
<p class="c010">Shearwater flattered himself that he had been extremely
patient. He had never got cross. He had just gone on
as though she weren’t there. As though she weren’t there.</p>
<p class="c010">“Hurry up,” he heard her calling. “The soup’s getting
cold.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Coming,” he shouted back, and began to dry his large,
blunt hands.</p>
<p class="c010">She seemed to have been improving lately. And to-night,
to-night she had been a model of non-existence.</p>
<p class="c010">He came striding heavily into the dining-room. Rosie
was sitting at the head of the table, ladling out the soup.
With her left hand she held back the flowing pink sleeve of
her kimono so that it should not trail in the plates or the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_144">144</span>tureen. Her bare arm showed white and pearly through
the steam of lentils.</p>
<p class="c010">How pretty she was! He could not resist the temptation,
but coming up behind her bent down and kissed her,
rather clumsily, on the back of her neck.</p>
<p class="c010">Rosie drew away from him. “Really, Jim,” she said,
disapprovingly. “At meal-times!” The fastidious lady
had to draw the line at these ill-timed, tumbling familiarities.</p>
<p class="c010">“And what about work-times?” Shearwater asked
laughing. “Still, you were wonderful this evening, Rosie,
quite wonderful.” He sat down and began eating his soup.
“Not a sound all the time I was reading; or, at any rate,
only one sound, so far as I remember.”</p>
<p class="c010">The great lady said nothing, but only smiled—a little
contemptuously and with a touch of pity. She pushed
away the plate of soup unfinished and planted her elbows
on the table. Slipping her hands under the sleeves of her
kimono, she began, lightly, delicately, with the tips of her
fingers, to caress her own arms.</p>
<p class="c010">How smooth they were, how soft and warm and how
secret under the sleeves. And all her body was as smooth
and warm, was as soft and secret, still more secret beneath
the pink folds. Like a warm serpent hidden away, secretly,
secretly.</p>

<span class="pageno" id="Page_145">145</span>
<h2 class="c008">CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>
<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c009">Mr. Boldero liked the idea of the Patent Small-Clothes.
He liked it immensely, he said, immensely.</p>
<p class="c010">“There’s money in it,” he said.</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Boldero was a small dark man of about forty-five,
active as a bird and with a bird’s brown, beady eyes, a bird’s
sharp nose. He was always busy, always had twenty
different irons in the fire at once, was always fresh, clearheaded,
never tired. He was also always unpunctual,
always untidy. He had no sense of time or of order. But
he got away with it, as he liked to say. He delivered the
goods—or rather the goods, in the convenient form of cash,
delivered themselves, almost miraculously it always seemed,
to him.</p>
<p class="c010">He was like a bird in appearance. But in mind, Gumbril
found, after having seen him once or twice, he was like a
caterpillar: he ate all that was put before him, he consumed
a hundred times his own mental weight every day.
Other people’s ideas, other people’s knowledge—they were
his food. He devoured them and they were at once his
own. All that belonged to other people he annexed
without a scruple or a second thought, quite naturally, as
though it were already his own. And he absorbed it so
rapidly and completely, he laid public claim to it so promptly
that he sometimes deceived people into believing that he
had really anticipated them in their ideas, that he had
<span class="pageno" id="Page_146">146</span>known for years and years the things they had just been
telling him, and which he would at once airily repeat to
them with the perfect assurance of one who knows—knows
by instinct, as it were, by inheritance.</p>
<p class="c010">At their first luncheon he had asked Gumbril to tell him
all about modern painting. Gumbril had given him a brief
lecture; before the savoury had appeared on the table,
Mr. Boldero was talking with perfect familiarity of Picasso
and Derain. He almost made it understood that he had
a fine collection of their works in his drawing-room at
home. Being a trifle deaf, however, he was not very good
at names, and Gumbril’s all-too-tactful corrections were
lost on him. He could not be induced to abandon his
Bacosso in favour of any other version of the Spaniard’s
name. Bacosso—why, he had known all about Bacosso
since he was a schoolboy! Bacosso was an old master,
already.</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Boldero was very severe with the waiters and knew
so well how things ought to be done at a good restaurant,
that Gumbril felt sure he must recently have lunched with
some meticulous gormandizer of the old school. And
when the waiter made as though to serve them with brandy
in small glasses, Mr. Boldero was so passionately indignant
that he sent for the manager.</p>
<p class="c010">“Do you mean to tell me,” he shouted in a perfect frenzy
of righteous anger, “that you don’t yet know how brandy
ought to be drunk?”</p>
<p class="c010">Perhaps it was only last week that he himself, Gumbril
reflected, had learned to aerate his cognac in Gargantuan
beakers.</p>
<p class="c010">Meanwhile, of course, the Patent Small-Clothes were
not neglected. As soon as he had been told about the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_147">147</span>things, Mr. Boldero began speaking of them with a perfect
and practised familiarity. They were already his, mentally
his. And it was only Mr. Boldero’s generosity that prevented
him from making the Small-Clothes more effectively
his own.</p>
<p class="c010">“If it weren’t for the friendship and respect which I feel
for your father, Mr. Gumbril,” he said, twinkling genially
over the brandy, “I’d just annex your Small-Clothes.
Bag and baggage. Just annex them.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Ah, but they’re my patent,” said Gumbril. “Or at
least they’re in process of being patented. The agents are
at work.”</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Boldero laughed. “Do you suppose that would
trouble me if I wanted to be unscrupulous? I’d just take
the idea and manufacture the article. You’d bring an
action. I’d have it defended with all the professional
erudition that could be brought. You’d find yourself let
in for a case that might cost thousands. And how would
you pay for it? You’d be forced to come to an agreement
out of court, Mr. Gumbril. That’s what you’d have to do.
And a damned bad agreement it would be for you, I can
tell you.” Mr. Boldero laughed very cheerfully at the
thought of the badness of this agreement. “But don’t be
alarmed,” he said. “I shan’t do it, you know.”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril was not wholly reassured. Tactfully, he tried
to find out what terms Mr. Boldero was prepared to offer.
Mr. Boldero was nebulously vague.</p>
<p class="c010">They met again in Gumbril’s rooms. The contemporary
drawings on the walls reminded Mr. Boldero that he was
now an art expert. He told Gumbril all about it—in
Gumbril’s own words. Every now and then, it was true,
Mr. Boldero made a little slip. Bacosso, for example,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_148">148</span>remained unshakably Bacosso. But on the whole the performance
was most impressive. It made Gumbril feel very
uncomfortable, however, while it lasted. For he recognized
in this characteristic of Mr. Boldero a horrible
caricature of himself. He too was an assimilator; more
discriminating, no doubt, more tactful, knowing better
than Mr. Boldero how to turn the assimilated experience
into something new and truly his own; but still a caterpillar,
definitely a caterpillar. He began studying Mr.
Boldero with a close and disgustful attention, as one might
pore over some repulsive <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">memento mori</span></i>.</p>
<p class="c010">It was a relief when Mr. Boldero stopped talking art and
consented to get down to business. Gumbril was wearing
for the occasion the sample pair of Small-Clothes which Mr.
Bojanus had made for him. For Mr. Boldero’s benefit
he put them, so to speak, through their paces. He allowed
himself to drop with a bump on to the floor—arriving
there bruiseless and unjarred. He sat in complete comfort
for minutes at a stretch on the edge of the ornamental iron
fender. In the intervals he paraded up and down before
Mr. Boldero like a mannequin. “A trifle bulgy,” said
Mr. Boldero. “But still....” He was, taking it all
round, favourably impressed. It was time, he said, to
begin thinking of details. They would have to begin by
making experiments with the bladders to discover a model
combining, as Mr. Boldero put it, ‘maximum efficiency
with minimum bulge.’ When they had found the right
thing, they would have it made in suitable quantities by
any good rubber firm. As for the trousers themselves,
they could rely for those on sweated female labour in the
East End. “Cheap and good,” said Mr. Boldero.</p>
<p class="c010">“It sounds ideal,” said Gumbril.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_149">149</span>“And then,” said Mr. Boldero, “there’s our advertising
campaign. On that I may say,” he went on with a certain
solemnity, “will depend the failure or success of our enterprise.
I consider it of the first importance.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Quite,” said Gumbril, nodding importantly and with
intelligence.</p>
<p class="c010">“We must set to work,” said Mr. Boldero, “sci—en—tifically.”
Gumbril nodded again.</p>
<p class="c010">“We have to appeal,” Mr. Boldero went on so glibly
that Gumbril felt sure he must be quoting somebody else’s
words, “to the great instincts and feelings of humanity....
They are the sources of action. They spend the money,
if I may put it like that.”</p>
<p class="c010">“That’s all very well,” said Gumbril. “But how do
you propose to appeal to the most important of the instincts?
I refer, as you may well imagine, to sex.”</p>
<p class="c010">“I was just going to come to that,” said Mr. Boldero,
raising his hand as though to ask for a patient hearing.
“Alas! we can’t. I don’t see any way of hanging our
Small-Clothes on the sexual peg.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Then we are undone,” said Gumbril, too dramatically.</p>
<p class="c010">“No, no.” Mr. Boldero was reassuring. “You make
the error of the Viennese. You exaggerate the importance
of sex. After all, my dear Mr. Gumbril, there is also the
instinct of self-preservation; there is also,” he leaned
forward, wagging his finger, “the social instinct, the instinct
of the herd.”</p>
<p class="c010">“True.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Both of them as powerful as sex. What are the Professor’s
famous Censors but forbidding suggestions from
the herd without, made powerful and entrenched by the
social instinct within?”</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_150">150</span>Gumbril had no answer; Mr. Boldero continued, smiling:</p>
<p class="c010">“So that we shall be all right if we stick to self-preservation
and the herd. Rub in the comfort and the utility,
the hygienic virtues of our Small-Clothes; that will catch
their self-preservatory feelings. Aim at their dread of
public opinion, at their ambition to be one better than
their fellows and their terror of being different—at all the
ludicrous weaknesses a well-developed social instinct exposes
them to. We shall get them, if we set to work scientifically.”
Mr. Boldero’s bird-like eyes twinkled very brightly. “We
shall get them,” he repeated, and he laughed a happy little
laugh, full of such a childlike diabolism, such an innocent
gay malignity that it seemed as though a little leprechaun
had suddenly taken the financier’s place in Gumbril’s best
arm-chair.</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril laughed too; for this leprechaunish mirth was
infectious. “We shall get them,” he echoed. “Oh, I’m
sure we shall, if you set about it, Mr. Boldero.”</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Boldero acknowledged the compliment with a smile
that expressed no false humility. It was his due, and he
knew it.</p>
<p class="c010">“I’ll give you some of my ideas about the advertising
campaign,” he said. “Just to give you a notion. You
can think them over, quietly, and make suggestions.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Yes, yes,” said Gumbril, nodding.</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Boldero cleared his throat. “We shall begin,” he
said, “by making the most simple elementary appeal to
their instinct of self-preservation: we shall point out that
the Patent Small-Clothes are comfortable; that to wear
them is to avoid pain. A few striking slogans about comfort—that’s
all we want. Very simple indeed. It doesn’t take
much to persuade a man that it’s pleasanter to sit on air
<span class="pageno" id="Page_151">151</span>than on wood. But while we’re on the subject of hard
seats we shall have to glide off subtly at a tangent to make
a flank attack on the social instincts.” And joining the tip
of his forefinger to the tip of his thumb, Mr. Boldero moved
his hand delicately sideways, as though he were sliding it
along a smooth brass rail. “We shall have to speak about
the glories and the trials of sedentary labour. We must
exalt its spiritual dignity and at the same time condemn
its physical discomforts. ‘The seat of honour,’ don’t you
know. We could talk about that. ‘The Seats of the
Mighty.’ ‘The seat that rules the office rocks the world.’
All those lines might be made something of. And then
we could have little historical chats about thrones; how
dignified, but how uncomfortable they’ve been. We must
make the bank clerk and the civil servant feel proud of being
what they are and at the same time feel ashamed that, being
such splendid people, they should have to submit to the
indignity of having blistered hind-quarters. In modern
advertising you must flatter your public—not in the oily,
abject, tradesmanlike style of the old advertisers, crawling
before clients who were their social superiors; that’s all
over now. It’s we who are the social superiors—because
we’ve got more money than the bank clerks and the civil
servants. Our modern flattery must be manly, straightforward,
sincere, the admiration of equal for equal—all the
more flattering as we aren’t equals.” Mr. Boldero laid a
finger to his nose. “They’re dirt and we’re capitalists....”
He laughed.</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril laughed too. It was the first time that he had
ever thought of himself as a capitalist, and the thought was
exhilarating.</p>
<p class="c010">“We flatter them,” went on Mr. Boldero. “We say
<span class="pageno" id="Page_152">152</span>that honest work is glorious and ennobling—which it isn’t;
it’s merely dull and cretinizing. And then we go on to
suggest that it would be finer still, more ennobling, because
less uncomfortable, if they wore Gumbril’s Patent Small-Clothes.
You see the line?”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril saw the line.</p>
<p class="c010">“After that,” said Mr. Boldero, “we get on to the
medical side of the matter. The medical side, Mr. Gumbril—that’s
most important. Nobody feels really well nowadays—at
any rate, nobody who lives in a big town and does
the kind of loathsome work that the people we’re catering
for does. Keeping this fact before our eyes, we have to make
it clear that only those can expect to be healthy who wear
pneumatic trousers.”</p>
<p class="c010">“That will be a little difficult, won’t it?” questioned
Gumbril.</p>
<p class="c010">“Not a bit of it!” Mr. Boldero laughed with an infectious
confidence. “All we have to do is to talk about
the great nerve centres of the spine: the shocks they get
when you sit down too hard; the wearing exhaustion to
which long-protracted sitting on unpadded seats subjects
them. We’ll have to talk very scientifically about the great
lumbar ganglia—if there are such things, which I really
don’t pretend to know. We’ll even talk almost mystically
about the ganglia. You know that sort of ganglion philosophy?”
Mr. Boldero went on parenthetically. “Very
interesting it is, sometimes, I think. We could put in a
lot about the dark, powerful sense-life, sex-life, instinct-life
which is controlled by the lumbar ganglion. How
important it is that that shouldn’t be damaged. That
already our modern conditions of civilization tend unduly
to develop the intellect and the thoracic ganglia controlling
<span class="pageno" id="Page_153">153</span>the higher emotions. That we’re wearing out, growing
feeble, losing our balance in consequence. And that the
only cure—if we are to continue our present mode of
civilized life—is to be found in Gumbril’s Patent Small-Clothes.”
Mr. Boldero brought his hand with an emphatic
smack on to the table as he spoke, as he fairly shouted, these
last words.</p>
<p class="c010">“Magnificent,” said Gumbril, with genuine admiration.</p>
<p class="c010">“This sort of medical and philosophical dope,” Mr.
Boldero went on, “is always very effective, if it’s properly
used. The public to whom we are making our appeal is,
of course, almost absolutely ignorant on these, or, indeed,
on almost all other subjects. It is therefore very much
impressed by the unfamiliar words; particularly if they
have such a good juicy sound as the word ‘ganglia.’”</p>
<p class="c010">“There was a young man of East Anglia, whose loins
were a tangle of ganglia,” murmured Gumbril, <em>improvisatore</em>.</p>
<p class="c010">“Precisely,” said Mr. Boldero. “Precisely. You see
how juicy it is? Well, as I say, they’re impressed. And
they’re also grateful. They’re grateful to us for having
given them a piece of abstruse, unlikely information which
they can pass on to their wives, or to such friends as they
know don’t read the paper in which our advertisement
appears—can pass on airily, don’t you know, with easy
erudition, as though they’d known all about ganglia from
their childhood. And they’ll feel such a flow of superiority
as they hand on the metaphysics and the pathology, that
they’ll always think of us with affection. They’ll buy our
breeks and they’ll get other people to buy. That’s why,”
Mr. Boldero went off again on an instructive tangent,
“that’s why the day of secret patent medicines is really
over. It’s no good saying you have rediscovered some secret
<span class="pageno" id="Page_154">154</span>known only, in the past, to the Egyptians. People don’t
know anything about Egyptology; but they have an
inkling that such a science exists. And that if it does
exist, it’s unlikely that patent medicine makers should have
found out facts unknown to the professors at the universities.
And it’s much the same even with secrets that
don’t come from Egypt. People know there’s such a thing
as medical science and they again feel it’s improbable that
manufacturers should know things ignored by the doctors.
The modern democratic advertiser is entirely above-board.
He tells you all about it. He explains that the digestive
juices acting on bismuth give rise to a disinfectant acid.
He points out that lactic ferment gets destroyed before
it reaches the large intestine, so that Metchnikoff’s cure
generally won’t work. And he goes on to explain that the
only way of getting the ferment there is to mix it with
starch and paraffin: starch to feed the ferment on,
paraffin to prevent the starch being digested before it gets
to the intestine. And in consequence, he convinces you that
a mixture of starch, paraffin and ferment is the only thing
that’s any good at all. Consequently you buy it; which
you would never have done without the explanation. In
the same way, Mr. Gumbril, we mustn’t ask people to take
our trousers on trust. We must explain scientifically why
these trousers will be good for their health. And by means
of the ganglia, as I’ve pointed out, we can even show that the
trousers will be good for their souls and the whole human
race at large. And as you probably know, Mr. Gumbril,
there’s nothing like a spiritual message to make things go.
Combine spirituality with practicality and you’ve fairly
got them. Got them, I may say, on toast. And that’s
what we can do with our trousers; we can put a message
<span class="pageno" id="Page_155">155</span>into them, a big, spiritual message. Decidedly,” he concluded,
“we shall have to work those ganglia all we can.”</p>
<p class="c010">“I’ll undertake to do that,” said Gumbril, who felt very
buoyant and self-assured. Mr. Boldero’s hydrogenous conversation
had blown him up like a balloon.</p>
<p class="c010">“And I’m sure you’ll do it well,” said Mr. Boldero
encouragingly. “There is no better training for modern
commerce than a literary education. As a practical
business man, I always uphold the ancient universities,
especially in their teaching of the Humanities.”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril was much flattered. At the moment, it seemed
supremely satisfying to be told that he was likely to make a
good business man. The business man took on a radiance,
began to glow, as it were, with a phosphorescent splendour.</p>
<p class="c010">“Then it’s very important,” continued Mr. Boldero, “to
play on their snobbism; to exploit that painful sense of
inferiority which the ignorant and ingenuous always feel
in the presence of the knowing. We’ve got to make our
trousers the Thing—socially right as well as merely personally
comfortable. We’ve got to imply somehow that it’s
bad form not to wear them. We’ve got to make those who
don’t wear them feel rather uncomfortable. Like that
film of Charlie Chaplin’s, where he’s the absent-minded
young man about town who dresses for dinner immaculately,
from the waist up—white waistcoat, tail coat, stiff shirt,
top-hat—and only discovers, when he gets down into the
hall of the hotel, that he’s forgotten to put on his trousers.
We’ve got to make them feel like that. That’s always
very successful. You know those excellent American advertisements
about young ladies whose engagements are
broken off because they perspire too freely or have an
unpleasant breath? How horribly uncomfortable those
<span class="pageno" id="Page_156">156</span>make you feel! We’ve got to do something of the same
sort for our trousers. Or more immediately applicable
would be those tailor’s advertisements about correct clothes.
‘Good clothes make you feel good.’ You know the sort
of line. And then those grave warning sentences in which
you’re told that a correctly cut suit may make the difference
between an appointment gained and an appointment lost,
an interview granted and an interview refused. But the
most masterly examples I can think of,” Mr. Boldero went
on with growing enthusiasm, “are those American advertisements
of spectacles, in which the manufacturers first
assume the existence of a social law about goggles, and then
proceed to invoke all the sanctions which fall on the head
of the committer of a solecism upon those who break it.
It’s masterly. For sport or relaxation, they tell you, as
though it was a social axiom, you must wear spectacles of
pure tortoiseshell. For business, tortoiseshell rims and
nickel ear-pieces lend incisive poise—incisive poise, we must
remember that for our ads, Mr. Gumbril. ‘Gumbril’s
Patent Small-Clothes lend incisive poise to business men.’
For semi-evening dress, shell rims with gold ear-pieces and
gold nose-bridge. And for full dress, gold-mounted rimless
pince-nez are refinement itself, and absolutely correct.
Thus we see, a social law has been created, according to
which every self-respecting myope or astigmat must have
four distinct pairs of glasses. Think if he should wear the
all-shell sports model with full dress! Revolting solecism!
The people who read advertisements like that begin to feel
uncomfortable; they have only one pair of glasses, they are
afraid of being laughed at, thought low-class and ignorant
and suburban. And since there are few who would not
rather be taken in adultery than in provincialism, they rush
<span class="pageno" id="Page_157">157</span>out to buy four new pairs of spectacles. And the manufacturer
gets rich, Mr. Gumbril. Now, we must do something
of the kind with our trousers. Imply somehow that
they’re correct, that you’re undressed without, that you’re
fiancée would break off the engagement if she saw you sitting
down to dinner on anything but air.” Mr. Boldero
shrugged his shoulders, vaguely waved his hand.</p>
<p class="c010">“It may be rather difficult,” said Gumbril, shaking his
head.</p>
<p class="c010">“It may,” Mr. Boldero agreed. “But difficulties are
made to be overcome. We must pull the string of snobbery
and shame: it’s essential. We must find out methods for
bringing the weight of public opinion to bear mockingly
on those who do not wear our trousers. It is difficult at
the moment to see how it can be done. But it will have
to be done, it will have to be done,” Mr. Boldero repeated
emphatically. “We might even find a way of invoking
patriotism to our aid. ‘English trousers filled with English
air, for English men.’ A little far-fetched, perhaps. But
there might be something in it.”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril shook his head doubtfully.</p>
<p class="c010">“Well, it’s one of the things we’ve got to think about
in any case,” said Mr. Boldero. “We can’t afford to neglect
such powerful social emotions as these. Sex, as we’ve seen,
is almost entirely out of the question. We must run the
rest, therefore, as hard as we can. For instance, there’s
the novelty business. People feel superior if they possess
something new which their neighbours haven’t got. The
mere fact of newness is an intoxication. We must encourage
that sense of superiority, brew up that intoxication. The
most absurd and futile objects can be sold because they’re
new. Not long ago I sold four million patent soap-dishes
<span class="pageno" id="Page_158">158</span>of a new and peculiar kind. The point was that you didn’t
screw the fixture into the bathroom wall; you made a hole
in the wall and built the soap-dish into a niche, like a holy
water stoup. My soap-dishes possessed no advantages over
other kinds of soap-dishes, and they cost a fantastic amount
to instal. But I managed to put them across, simply
because they were new. Four million of them.” Mr.
Boldero smiled with satisfaction at the recollection. “We
shall do the same, I hope, with our trousers. People may
be shy of being the first to appear in them; but the shyness
will be compensated for by the sense of superiority and
elation produced by the consciousness of the newness of the
things.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Quite so,” said Gumbril.</p>
<p class="c010">“And then, of course, there’s the economy slogan. ‘One
pair of Gumbril’s Patent Small-Clothes will outlast six pairs
of ordinary trousers.’ That’s easy enough. So easy that it’s
really uninteresting.” Mr. Boldero waved it away.</p>
<p class="c010">“We shall have to have pictures,” said Gumbril, parenthetically.
He had an idea.</p>
<p class="c010">“Oh, of course.”</p>
<p class="c010">“I believe I know of the very man to do them,” Gumbril
went on. “His name’s Lypiatt. A painter. You’ve
probably heard of him.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Heard of him!” exclaimed Mr. Boldero. He laughed.
“But who hasn’t heard of Lydgate.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Lypiatt.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Lypgate, I mean, of course.”</p>
<p class="c010">“I think he’d be the very man,” said Gumbril.</p>
<p class="c010">“I’m certain he would,” said Mr. Boldero, not a whit
behind-hand.</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril was pleased with himself. He felt he had done
<span class="pageno" id="Page_159">159</span>some one a good turn. Poor old Lypiatt; be glad of the
money. Gumbril remembered also his own fiver. And
remembering his own fiver, he also remembered that Mr.
Boldero had as yet made no concrete suggestion about
terms. He nerved himself at last to suggest to Mr. Boldero
that it was time to think of this little matter. Ah, how
he hated talking about money! He found it so hard to be
firm in asserting his rights. He was ashamed of showing
himself grasping. He always thought with consideration
of the other person’s point of view—poor devil, could he
afford to pay? And he was always swindled and always
conscious of the fact. Lord, how he hated life on these
occasions! Mr. Boldero was still evasive.</p>
<p class="c010">“I’ll write you a letter about it,” he said at last.</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril was delighted. “Yes, do,” he said enthusiastically,
“do.” He knew how to cope with letters all
right. He was a devil with the fountain pen. It was these
personal, hand-to-hand combats that he couldn’t manage.
He could have been, he always felt, such a ruthless critic
and satirist, such a violent, unscrupulous polemical writer.
And if ever he committed his autobiography to paper, how
breath-takingly intimate, how naked—naked without so
much as a healthy sunburn to colour the whiteness—how
quiveringly a sensitive jelly it would be! All the things
he had never told any one would be in it. Confession at
long range—if anything, it would be rather agreeable.</p>
<p class="c010">“Yes, do write me a letter,” he repeated. “Do.”</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Boldero’s letter came at last, and the proposals it
contained were derisory. A hundred pounds down and
five pounds a week when the business should be started.
Five pounds a week—and for that he was to act as a managing
director, writer of advertisements and promoter of foreign
<span class="pageno" id="Page_160">160</span>sales. Gumbril felt thankful that Mr. Boldero had put
the terms in a letter. If they had been offered point-blank
across the luncheon table, he would probably have accepted
them without a murmur. He wrote a few neat, sharp
phrases saying that he could not consider less than five
hundred pounds down and a thousand a year. Mr. Boldero’s
reply was amiable; would Mr. Gumbril come and see him?</p>
<p class="c010">See him? Well, of course, it was inevitable. He would
have to see him again some time. But he would send the
Complete Man to deal with the fellow. A Complete Man
matched with a leprechaun—there could be no doubt as
to the issue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="c010">“<span class="sc">Dear Mr. Boldero</span>,” he wrote back, “I should have
come to talk over matters before this. But I have been
engaged during the last days in growing a beard and until
this has come to maturity, I cannot, as you will easily be
able to understand, leave the house. By the day after to-morrow,
however, I hope to be completely presentable and
shall come to see you at your office at about three o’clock,
if that is convenient to you. I hope we shall be able to
arrange matters satisfactorily.—Believe me, dear Mr.
Boldero, yours very truly,</p>
<div class="c013"><span class="sc">Theodore Gumbril, Jr</span>.”</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="c010">The day after to-morrow became in due course to-day;
splendidly bearded and Rabelaisianly broad in his whipcord
toga, Gumbril presented himself at Mr. Boldero’s office in
Queen Victoria Street.</p>
<p class="c010">“I should hardly have recognized you,” exclaimed Mr.
Boldero as he shook hands. “How it does alter you, to
be sure!”</p>
<p class="c010">“Does it?” The Complete Man laughed with a
significant joviality.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_161">161</span>“Won’t you take off your coat?”</p>
<p class="c010">“No, thanks,” said Gumbril. “I’ll keep it on.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Well,” said the leprechaun, leaning back in his chair
and twinkling, bird-like, across the table.</p>
<p class="c010">“Well,” repeated Gumbril on a different tone from
behind the stooks of his corn-like beard. He smiled, feeling
serenely strong and safe.</p>
<p class="c010">“I’m sorry we should have disagreed,” said Mr. Boldero.</p>
<p class="c010">“So am I,” the Complete Man replied. “But we shan’t
disagree for long,” he added, with significance; and as he
spoke the words he brought down his fist with such a bang,
that the inkpots on Mr. Boldero’s very solid mahogany
writing-table trembled and the pens danced, while Mr.
Boldero himself started with a genuine alarm. He had
not expected them. And now he came to look at him more
closely, this young Gumbril was a great, hulking, dangerous-looking
fellow. He had thought he would be easy to
manage. How could he have made such a mistake?</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril left the office with Mr. Boldero’s cheque for
three hundred and fifty pounds in his pocket and an annual
income of eight hundred. His bruised right hand was
extremely tender to the touch. He was thankful that a
single blow had been enough.</p>
<div class="chapter">
<span class="pageno" id="Page_162">162</span>
<h2 class="c008">CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>
<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c009">Gumbril had spent the afternoon at Bloxam
Gardens. His chin was still sore from the spirit
gum with which he had attached to it the
symbol of the Complete Man; he was feeling also a little
fatigued. Rosie had been delighted to see him; St.
Jerome had gone on solemnly communicating all the time.</p>
<p class="c010">His father had gone out to dine, and Gumbril had eaten
his rump steak and drunk his bottle of stout alone. He was
sitting now in front of the open French windows which
led from his father’s workroom on to the balcony, with a
block on his knee and a fountain-pen in his hand, composing
advertisements for the Patent Small-Clothes. Outside, in
the plane trees of the square, the birds had gone through
their nightly performance. But Gumbril had paid no
attention to them. He sat there, smoking, sometimes
writing a word or two—sunk in the quagmire of his own
drowsy and comfortable body. The flawless weather of the
day had darkened into a blue May evening. It was agreeable
merely to be alive.</p>
<p class="c010">He sketched out two or three advertisements in the grand
idealistic transatlantic style. He imagined one in particular
with a picture of Nelson at the head of the page and ‘England
expects ...’ printed large beneath it. “England ...
Duty ... these are solemn words.” That was how
it would begin. “These are solemn words, and we use
them solemnly as men who realize what Duty is, and who do
<span class="pageno" id="Page_163">163</span>all that in them lies to perform it as Englishmen should.
The Manufacturer’s is a sacred trust. The guide and ruler
of the modern world, he has, like the Monarch of other days,
responsibilities towards his people; he has a Duty to fulfil.
He rules, but he must also serve. We realize our responsibilities,
we take them seriously. Gumbril’s Patent Small-Clothes
have been brought into the world that they may
serve. Our Duty towards you is a Duty of Service. Our
proud boast is that we perform it. But besides his Duty
towards Others, every man has a duty towards Himself.
What is that Duty? It is to keep himself in the highest
possible state of physical and spiritual fitness. Gumbril’s
Patent Small-Clothes protect the lumbar ganglia....”
After that it would be plain medical and mystical sailing.</p>
<p class="c010">As soon as he got to the ganglia, Gumbril stopped writing.
He put down the block, sheathed his pen, and abandoned
himself to the pleasures of pure idleness. He sat, he smoked
his cigar. In the basement, two floors down, the cook and
the house-parlourmaid were reading—one the <cite>Daily Mirror</cite>,
the other the <cite>Daily Sketch</cite>. For them, Her Majesty the
Queen spoke kindly words to crippled female orphans;
the jockeys tumbled at the jumps; Cupid was busy in
Society, and the murderers who had disembowelled their
mistresses were at large. Above him was the city of models,
was a bedroom, a servant’s bedroom, an attic of tanks and
ancient dirt, the roof and, after that, two or three hundred
light-years away, a star of the fourth magnitude. On the
other side of the party-wall on his right, a teeming family
of Jews led their dark, compact, Jewish lives with a prodigious
intensity. At this moment they were all passionately
quarrelling. Beyond the wall on the left lived the
young journalist and his wife. To-night it was he who had
<span class="pageno" id="Page_164">164</span>cooked the supper. The young wife lay on the sofa, feeling
horribly sick; she was going to have a baby, there could
be no doubt about it now. They had meant not to have
one; it was horrible. And, outside, the birds were sleeping
in the trees, the invading children from the slum tumbled
and squealed. Ships meanwhile were walloping across the
Atlantic freighted with more cigars. Rosie at this moment
was probably mending Shearwater’s socks. Gumbril sat
and smoked, and the universe arranged itself in a pattern
about him, like iron filings round a magnet.</p>
<p class="c010">The door opened, and the house-parlourmaid intruded
Shearwater upon his lazy felicity, abruptly, in her unceremonious
old way, and hurried back to the <cite>Daily Sketch</cite>.</p>
<p class="c010">“Shearwater! This is very agreeable,” said Gumbril.
“Come and sit down.” He pointed to a chair.</p>
<p class="c010">Clumsily, filling the space that two ordinary men would
occupy, Shearwater came zigzagging and lurching across
the room, bumped against the work-table and the sofa as
he passed, and finally sat down in the indicated chair.</p>
<p class="c010">It suddenly occurred to Gumbril that this was Rosie’s
husband: he had not thought of that before. Could it
be in the marital capacity that he presented himself so unexpectedly
now? After this afternoon.... He had come
home; Rosie had confessed all.... Ah! but then she
didn’t know who he was. He smiled to himself at the
thought. What a joke! Perhaps Shearwater had come to
complain to him of the unknown Complete Man—to
him! It was delightful. Anon—the author of all those
ballads in the <cite>Oxford Book of English Verse</cite>: the famous
Italian painter—Ignoto. Gumbril was quite disappointed
when his visitor began to talk of other themes than Rosie.
Sunk in the quagmire of his own comfortable guts, he felt
<span class="pageno" id="Page_165">165</span>good-humouredly obscene. The dramatic scabrousness of
the situation would have charmed him in his present mood.
Good old Shearwater—but what an ox of a man! If he,
Gumbril, took the trouble to marry a wife, he would at
least take some interest in her.</p>
<p class="c010">Shearwater had begun to talk in general terms about life.
What could he be getting at, Gumbril wondered? What
particulars were ambushed behind these generalizations?
There were silences. Shearwater looked, he thought, very
gloomy. Under his thick moustache the small, pouting,
babyish mouth did not smile. The candid eyes had a
puzzled, tired expression in them.</p>
<p class="c010">“People are queer,” he said after one of his silences.
“Very queer. One has no idea how queer they are.”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril laughed. “But I have a very clear idea of
their queerness,” he said. “Every one’s queer, and the
ordinary, respectable, bourgeois people are the queerest of
the lot. How do they manage to live like that? It’s
astonishing. When I think of all my aunts and uncles....”
He shook his head.</p>
<p class="c010">“Perhaps it’s because I’m rather incurious,” said Shearwater.
“One ought to be curious, I think. I’ve come to
feel lately that I’ve not been curious enough about people.”
The particulars began to peep, alive and individual, out of
the vagueness, like rabbits; Gumbril saw them in his fancy,
at the fringe of a wood.</p>
<p class="c010">“Quite,” he said encouragingly. “Quite.”</p>
<p class="c010">“I think too much of my work,” Shearwater went
on, frowning. “Too much physiology. There’s also
psychology. People’s minds as well as their bodies....
One shouldn’t be limited. Not too much, at any rate.
People’s minds....” He was silent for a moment. “I
<span class="pageno" id="Page_166">166</span>can imagine,” he went on at last, as in the tone of one who
puts a very hypothetical case, “I can imagine one’s getting
so much absorbed in somebody else’s psychology that one
could really think of nothing else.” The rabbits seemed
ready to come out into the open.</p>
<p class="c010">“That’s a process,” said Gumbril, with middle-aged
jocularity, speaking out of his private warm morass, “that’s
commonly called falling in love.”</p>
<p class="c010">There was another silence. Shearwater broke it to begin
talking about Mrs. Viveash. He had lunched with her
three or four days running. He wanted Gumbril to tell
him what she was really like. “She seems to me a very
extraordinary woman,” he said.</p>
<p class="c010">“Like everybody else,” said Gumbril irritatingly. It
amused him to see the rabbits scampering about at last.</p>
<p class="c010">“I’ve never known a woman like that before.”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril laughed. “You’d say that of any woman you
happened to be interested in,” he said. “You’ve never
known any women at all.” He knew much more about
Rosie, already, than Shearwater did, or probably ever would.</p>
<p class="c010">Shearwater meditated. He thought of Mrs. Viveash,
her cool, pale, critical eyes; her laughter, faint and mocking;
her words that pierced into the mind, goading it into
thinking unprecedented thoughts.</p>
<p class="c010">“She interests me,” he repeated. “I want you to tell
me what she’s really like.” He emphasized the word really,
as though there must, in the nature of things, be a vast
difference between the apparent and the real Mrs. Viveash.</p>
<p class="c010">Most lovers, Gumbril reflected, picture to themselves, in
their mistresses, a secret reality, beyond and different from
what they see every day. They are in love with somebody
else—their own invention. And sometimes there is a secret
<span class="pageno" id="Page_167">167</span>reality; and sometimes reality and appearance are the
same. The discovery, in either case, is likely to cause a
shock. “I don’t know,” he said. “How should I know?
You must find out for yourself.”</p>
<p class="c010">“But you knew her, you know her well,” said Shearwater,
almost with anxiety in his voice.</p>
<p class="c010">“Not so well as all that.”</p>
<p class="c010">Shearwater sighed profoundly, like a whale in the night.
He felt restless, incapable of concentrating. His mind was
full of a horrible confusion. A violent eruptive bubbling
up from below had shaken its calm clarity to pieces. All
this absurd business of passion—he had always thought it
nonsense, unnecessary. With a little strength of will one
could shut it out. Women—only for half an hour out of
the twenty-four. But she had laughed, and his quiet, his
security had vanished. “I can imagine,” he had said to
her yesterday, “I can imagine myself giving up everything,
work and all, to go running round after you.” “And do
you suppose I should enjoy that?” Mrs. Viveash had asked.
“It would be ridiculous,” he said, “it would be almost
shameful.” And she had thanked him for the compliment.
“And at the same time,” he went on, “I feel that it might
be worth it. It might be the only thing.” His mind
was confused, full of new thoughts. “It’s difficult,” he
said after a pause, “arranging things. Very difficult. I
thought I had arranged them so well....”</p>
<p class="c010">“I never arrange anything,” said Gumbril, very much
the practical philosopher. “I take things as they come.”
And as he spoke the words, suddenly he became rather disgusted
with himself. He shook himself; he climbed up
out of his own morass. “It would be better, perhaps, if
I arranged things more,” he added.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_168">168</span>“Render therefore unto Cæsar the things which are
Cæsar’s,” said Shearwater, as though to himself; “and
to God, and to sex, and to work.... There must be
a working arrangement.” He sighed again. “Everything
in proportion. In proportion,” he repeated, as
though the word were magical and had power. “In
proportion.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Who’s talking about proportion?” They turned
round. In the doorway Gumbril Senior was standing,
smoothing his ruffled hair and tugging at his beard. His
eyes twinkled cheerfully behind his spectacles. “Poaching
on my architectural ground?” he said.</p>
<p class="c010">“This is Shearwater,” Gumbril Junior put in, and explained
who he was.</p>
<p class="c010">The old gentleman sat down. “Proportion,” he said—“I
was just thinking about it, now, as I was walking back.
You can’t help thinking about it in these London streets,
where it doesn’t exist. You can’t help pining for it. There
are some streets ... oh, my God!” And Gumbril
Senior threw up his hands in horror. “It’s like listening
to a symphony of cats to walk along them. Senseless discords
and a horrible disorder all the way. And the one
street that was really like a symphony by Mozart—how
busily and gleefully they’re pulling it down now! Another
year and there’ll be nothing left of Regent Street. There’ll
only be a jumble of huge, hideous buildings at three-quarters
of a million apiece. A concert of Brobdingnagian cats.
Order has been turned into a disgusting chaos. We need
no barbarians from outside; they’re on the premises, all
the time.”</p>
<p class="c010">The old man paused and pulled his beard meditatively.
Gumbril Junior sat in silence, smoking; and in silence
<span class="pageno" id="Page_169">169</span>Shearwater revolved within the walls of his great round
head his agonizing thoughts of Mrs. Viveash.</p>
<p class="c010">“It has always struck me as very curious,” Gumbril
Senior went on, “that people are so little affected by the
vile and discordant architecture around them. Suppose,
now, that all these brass bands of unemployed ex-soldiers
that blow so mournfully at all the street corners were
suddenly to play nothing but a series of senseless and devilish
discords—why, the first policeman would move them on,
and the second would put them under arrest, and the
passers-by would try to lynch them on their way to the
police station. There would be a real spontaneous outcry
of indignation. But when at these same street corners the
contractors run up enormous palaces of steel and stone that
are every bit as stupid and ignoble and inharmonious as ten
brass bandsmen each playing a different tune in a different
key, there is no outcry. The police don’t arrest the architect;
the passing pedestrians don’t throw stones at the
workmen. They don’t notice that anything’s wrong. It’s
odd,” said Gumbril Senior. “It’s very odd.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Very odd,” Gumbril Junior echoed.</p>
<p class="c010">“The fact is, I suppose,” Gumbril Senior went on,
smiling with a certain air of personal triumph, “the fact
is that architecture is a more difficult and intellectual art
than music. Music—that’s just a faculty you’re born with,
as you might be born with a snub nose. But the sense of
plastic beauty—though that’s, of course, also an inborn
faculty—is something that has to be developed and intellectually
ripened. It’s an affair of the mind; experience
and thought have to draw it out. There are infant prodigies
in music; but there are no infant prodigies in architecture.”
Gumbril Senior chuckled with a real satisfaction.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_170">170</span>“A man can be an excellent musician and a perfect imbecile.
But a good architect must also be a man of sense,
a man who knows how to think and to profit by experience.
Now, as almost none of the people who pass along the streets
in London, or any other city of the world, do know how to
think or to profit by experience, it follows that they cannot
appreciate architecture. The innate faculty is strong
enough in them to make them dislike discord in music;
but they haven’t the wits to develop that other innate
faculty—the sense of plastic beauty—which would enable
them to see and disapprove of the same barbarism in architecture.
Come with me,” Gumbril Senior added, getting
up from his chair, “and I’ll show you something that will
illustrate what I’ve been saying. Something you’ll enjoy,
too. Nobody’s seen it yet,” he said mysteriously as he
led the way upstairs. “It’s only just finished—after
months and years. It’ll cause a stir when they see it—when
I let them see it, if ever I do, that is. The dirty
devils!” Gumbril Senior added good-humouredly.</p>
<p class="c010">On the landing of the next floor he paused, felt in his
pocket, took out a key and unlocked the door of what should
have been the second best bedroom. Gumbril Junior
wondered, without very much curiosity, what the new toy
would turn out to be. Shearwater wondered only how he
could possess Mrs. Viveash.</p>
<p class="c010">“Come on,” called Gumbril Senior from inside the room.
He turned on the light. They entered.</p>
<p class="c010">It was a big room; but almost the whole of the floor
was covered by an enormous model, twenty feet long by
ten or twelve wide, of a complete city traversed from end to
end by a winding river and dominated at its central point
by a great dome. Gumbril Junior looked at it with surprise
<span class="pageno" id="Page_171">171</span>and pleasure. Even Shearwater was roused from his bitter
ruminations of desire to look at the charming city spread out
at his feet.</p>
<p class="c010">“It’s exquisite,” said Gumbril Junior. “What is it?
The capital of Utopia, or what?”</p>
<p class="c010">Delighted, Gumbril Senior laughed. “Don’t you see
something rather familiar in the dome?” he asked.</p>
<p class="c010">“Well, I had thought ...” Gumbril Junior hesitated,
afraid that he might be going to say something stupid. He
bent down to look more closely at the dome. “I had
thought it looked rather like St. Paul’s—and now I see
that it is St. Paul’s.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Quite right,” said his father. “And this is London.”</p>
<p class="c010">“I wish it were,” Gumbril Junior laughed.</p>
<p class="c010">“It’s London as it might have been if they’d allowed
Wren to carry out his plans of rebuilding after the Great
Fire.”</p>
<p class="c010">“And why didn’t they allow him to?” Shearwater
asked.</p>
<p class="c010">“Chiefly,” said Gumbril Senior, “because, as I’ve said
before, they didn’t know how to think or profit by experience.
Wren offered them open spaces and broad streets;
he offered them sunlight and air and cleanliness; he offered
them beauty, order and grandeur. He offered to build for
the imagination and the ambitious spirit of man, so that
even the most bestial, vaguely and remotely, as they walked
those streets, might feel that they were of the same race—or
very nearly—as Michelangelo; that they too might feel
themselves, in spirit at least, magnificent, strong and free.
He offered them all these things; he drew a plan for them,
walking in peril among the still smouldering ruins. But
they preferred to re-erect the old intricate squalor; they
<span class="pageno" id="Page_172">172</span>preferred the mediæval darkness and crookedness and beastly
irregular quaintness; they preferred holes and crannies
and winding tunnels; they preferred foul smells, sunless,
stagnant air, phthisis and rickets; they preferred ugliness
and pettiness and dirt; they preferred the wretched human
scale, the scale of the sickly body, not of the mind. Miserable
fools! But I suppose,” the old man continued, shaking
his head, “we can’t blame them.” His hair had blown
loose from its insecure anchorage; with a gesture of resignation
he brushed it back into place. “We can’t blame
them. We should have done the same in the circumstances—undoubtedly.
People offer us reason and beauty;
but we will have none of them, because they don’t happen
to square with the notions that were grafted into our souls
in youth, that have grown there and become a part of us.
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Experientia docet</span></i>—nothing falser, so far as most of us are
concerned, was ever said. You, no doubt, my dear Theodore,
have often in the past made a fool of yourself with
women....”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril Junior made an embarrassed gesture that half
denied, half admitted the soft impeachment. Shearwater
turned away, painfully reminded of what, for a moment,
he had half forgotten. Gumbril Senior swept on.</p>
<p class="c010">“Will that prevent you from making as great a fool of
yourself again to-morrow? It will not. It will most
assuredly not.” Gumbril Senior shook his head. “The
inconveniences and horrors of the pox are perfectly well
known to every one; but still the disease flourishes and
spreads. Several million people were killed in a recent war
and half the world ruined; but we all busily go on in
courses that make another event of the same sort inevitable.
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Experientia docet? Experientia</span></i> doesn’t. And that is
<span class="pageno" id="Page_173">173</span>why we must not be too hard on these honest citizens
of London who, fully appreciating the inconveniences of
darkness, disorder and dirt, manfully resisted any attempt
to alter conditions which they had been taught from childhood
onwards to consider as necessary, right and belonging
inevitably to the order of things. We must not be too
hard. We are doing something even worse ourselves.
Knowing by a century of experience how beautiful, how
graceful, how soothing to the mind is an ordered piece of
town-planning, we pull down almost the only specimen of
it we possess and put up in its place a chaos of Portland
stone that is an offence against civilization. But let us
forget about these old citizens and the labyrinth of
ugliness and inconvenience which we have inherited
from them, and which is called London. Let us forget
the contemporaries who are making it still worse than it
was. Come for a walk with me through this ideal city.
Look.”</p>
<p class="c010">And Gumbril Senior began expounding it to them.</p>
<p class="c010">In the middle, there, of that great elliptical Piazza at
the eastern end of the new City, stands, four-square, the
Royal Exchange. Pierced only with small dark windows,
and built of rough ashlars of the silvery Portland stone, the
ground floor serves as a massy foundation for the huge
pilasters that slide up, between base and capital, past three
tiers of pedimented windows. Upon them rest the cornice,
the attic and the balustrade, and on every pier of the balustrade
a statue holds up its symbol against the sky. Four
great portals, rich with allegory, admit to the courtyard
with its double tier of coupled columns, its cloister and
its gallery. The statue of Charles the Martyr rides
triumphantly in the midst, and within the windows one
<span class="pageno" id="Page_174">174</span>guesses the great rooms, rich with heavy garlands of plaster,
panelled with carved wood.</p>
<p class="c010">Ten streets give on to the Piazza, and at either end of
its ellipse the water of sumptuous fountains ceaselessly
blows aloft and falls. Commerce, in that to the north
of the Exchange, holds up her cornucopia, and from the
midst of its grapes and apples the master jet leaps up; from
the teats of all the ten Useful Arts, grouped with their
symbols about the central figure, there spouts a score of fine
subsidiary streams. The dolphins, the sea-horses and the
Tritons sport in the basin below. To the south, the ten
principal cities of the Kingdom stand in a family round the
Mother London, who pours from her urn an inexhaustible
Thames.</p>
<p class="c010">Ranged round the Piazza are the Goldsmiths’ Hall, the
Office of Excise, the Mint, the Post Office. Their flanks
are curved to the curve of the ellipse. Between pilasters,
their windows look out on to the Exchange, and the sister
statues on the balustrades beckon to one another across the
intervening space.</p>
<p class="c010">Two master roads of ninety feet from wall to wall run
westwards from the Exchange. New Gate ends the more
northern vista with an Arch of Triumph, whose three openings
are deep, shadowy and solemn as the entries of caverns.
The Guildhall and the halls of the twelve City Companies
in their livery of rose-red brick, with their lacings of white
stone at the coigns and round the windows, lend to the
street an air of domestic and comfortable splendour. And
every two or three hundred paces the line of the houses is
broken, and in the indentation of a square recess there rises,
conspicuous and insular, the fantastic tower of a parish
church. Spire out of dome; octagon on octagon diminishing
<span class="pageno" id="Page_175">175</span>upwards; cylinder on cylinder; round lanterns,
lanterns of many sides; towers with airy pinnacles; clusters
of pillars linked by incurving cornices, and above them,
four more clusters and above once more; square towers
pierced with pointed windows; spires uplifted on flying
buttresses; spires bulbous at the base—the multitude of
them beckons, familiar and friendly, on the sky. From
the other shore, or sliding along the quiet river, you see
them all, you tell over their names; and the great dome
swells up in the midst overtopping them all.</p>
<p class="c010">The dome of St. Paul’s.</p>
<p class="c010">The other master street that goes westward from the
Piazza of the Exchange slants down towards it. The
houses are of brick, plain-faced and square, arcaded at the
base, so that the shops stand back from the street and the
pedestrian walks dry-shod under the harmonious succession
of the vaultings. And there at the end of the street, at the
base of a triangular space formed by the coming together
of this with another master street that runs eastwards to
Tower Hill, there stands the Cathedral. To the north of
it is the Deanery and under the arcades are the booksellers’
shops.</p>
<p class="c010">From St. Paul’s the main road slopes down under the
swaggering Italianate arches of Ludgate, past the wide
lime-planted boulevards that run north and south within
and without the city wall, to the edge of the Fleet Ditch—widened
now into a noble canal, on whose paved banks the
barges unload their freights of country stuff—leaps it on a
single flying arch to climb again to a round circus, a little
to the east of Temple Bar, from which, in a pair of diagonally
superimposed crosses, eight roads radiate: three northwards
towards Holborn, three from the opposite arc towards
<span class="pageno" id="Page_176">176</span>the river, one eastward to the City, and one past Lincoln’s
Inn Fields to the west. The piazza is all of brick and the
houses that compose it are continuous above the ground-floor
level; for the roads lead out under archways. To one
who stands in the centre at the foot of the obelisk that
commemorates the victory over the Dutch, it seems a
smooth well of brickwork pierced by eight arched conduits
at the base and diversified above by the three tiers of plain,
unornamented windows.</p>
<p class="c010">Who shall describe all the fountains in the open places,
all the statues and monuments? In the circus north of
London Bridge, where the four roads come together, stands
a pyramid of nymphs and Tritons—river goddesses of
Polyolbion, sea-gods of the island beaches—bathing in a
ceaseless tumble of white water. And here the city griffon
spouts from its beak, the royal lion from between its jaws.
St. George at the foot of the Cathedral rides down a dragon
whose nostrils spout, not fire, but the clear water of the
New River. In front of the India House, four elephants
of black marble, endorsed with towers of white, blow through
their upturned trunks the copious symbol of Eastern wealth.
In the gardens of the Tower sits Charles the Second, enthroned
among a troop of Muses, Cardinal Virtues, Graces
and Hours. The tower of the Customs-House is a pharos.
A great water-gate, the symbol of naval triumph, spans the
Fleet at its junction with the Thames. The river is
embanked from Blackfriars to the Tower, and at every
twenty paces a grave stone angel looks out from the piers
of the balustrade across the water....</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril Senior expounded his city with passion. He
pointed to the model on the ground, he lifted his arms and
turned up his eyes to suggest the size and splendour of his
<span class="pageno" id="Page_177">177</span>edifices. His hair blew wispily loose and fell into his eyes,
and had to be brushed impatiently back again. He pulled
at his beard; his spectacles flashed, as though they were
living eyes. Looking at him, Gumbril Junior could imagine
that he saw before him the passionate and gesticulating
silhouette of one of those old shepherds who stand at the
base of Piranesi’s ruins demonstrating obscurely the prodigious
grandeur and the abjection of the human race.</p>
<div class="chapter">
<span class="pageno" id="Page_178">178</span>
<h2 class="c008">CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>
<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c009">“You? Is it you?” She seemed doubtful.</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril nodded. “It’s me,” he reassured
her. “I’ve shaved; that’s all.” He had left his
beard in the top right-hand drawer of the chest of drawers,
among the ties and the collars.</p>
<p class="c010">Emily looked at him judicially. “I like you better
without it,” she decided at last. “You look nicer. Oh no,
I don’t mean to say you weren’t nice before,” she hastened
to add. “But—you know—gentler——” She hesitated.
“It’s a silly word,” she said, “but there it is: sweeter.”</p>
<p class="c010">That was the unkindest cut of all. “Milder and more
melancholy?” he suggested.</p>
<p class="c010">“Well, if you like to put it like that,” Emily agreed.</p>
<p class="c010">He took her hand and raised it to his lips. “I forgive
you,” he said.</p>
<p class="c010">He could forgive her anything for the sake of those candid
eyes, anything for the grave, serious mouth, anything for
the short brown hair that curled—oh, but never seriously,
never gravely—with such a hilarious extravagance round
her head. He had met her, or rather the Complete Man,
flushed with his commercial triumphs as he returned from
his victory over Mr. Boldero, had met her at the National
Gallery. “Old Masters, young mistresses;” Coleman had
recommended the National Gallery. He was walking up
the Venetian Room, feeling as full of swaggering vitality as
the largest composition of Veronese, when he heard,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_179">179</span>gigglingly whispered just behind him his Open Sesame to
new adventure, “Beaver.” He spun round on his tracks
and found himself face to face with two rather startled young
women. He frowned ferociously: he demanded satisfaction
for the impertinence. They were both, he noticed, of
gratifyingly pleasing appearance and both extremely young.
One of them, the elder it seemed, and the more charming,
as he had decided from the first, of the two, was dreadfully
taken aback; blushed to the eyes, stammered apologetically.
But the other, who had obviously pronounced the
word, only laughed. It was she who made easy the forming
of an acquaintance which ripened, half an hour later, over
the tea-cups and to the strains of the most classy music on
the fifth floor of Lyons’s Strand Corner House.</p>
<p class="c010">Their names were Emily and Molly. Emily, it seemed,
was married. It was Molly who let that out, and the other
had been angry with her for what was evidently an indiscretion.
The bald fact that Emily was married had at once
been veiled with mysteries, surrounded and protected by
silences; whenever the Complete Man asked a question
about it, Emily did not answer and Molly only giggled.
But if Emily was married and the elder of the two, Molly
was decidedly the more knowledgeable about life; Mr.
Mercaptan would certainly have set her down as the more
civilized. Emily didn’t live in London; she didn’t seem
to live anywhere in particular. At the moment she was
staying with Molly’s family at Kew.</p>
<p class="c010">He had seen them the next day, and the day after, and
the day after that; once at lunch, to desert them precipitately
for his afternoon with Rosie; once at tea in Kew
Gardens; once at dinner, with a theatre to follow and an
extravagant taxi back to Kew at midnight. The tame
<span class="pageno" id="Page_180">180</span>decoy allays the fears of the shy wild birds; Molly, who
was tame, who was frankly a flirting little wanton, had
served the Complete Man as a decoy for the ensnaring of
Emily. When Molly went away to stay with friends in the
country, Emily was already inured and accustomed to the
hunter’s presence; she accepted the playful attitude of
gallantry, which the Complete Man, at the invitation of
Molly’s rolling eyes and provocative giggle, had adopted
from the first, as natural and belonging to the established
order of things. With giggling Molly to give her a lead,
she had gone in three days much further along the path of
intimacy than, by herself, she would have advanced in ten
times the number of meetings.</p>
<p class="c010">“It seems funny,” she had said the first time they met
after Molly’s departure, “it seems funny to be seeing you
without Molly.”</p>
<p class="c010">“It seemed funnier with Molly,” said the Complete Man.
“It wasn’t Molly I wanted to see.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Molly’s a very nice, dear girl,” she declared loyally.
“Besides, she’s amusing and can talk. And I can’t; I’m
not a bit amusing.”</p>
<p class="c010">It wasn’t difficult to retort to that sort of thing; but
Emily didn’t believe in compliments; oh, quite genuinely
not.</p>
<p class="c010">He set out to make the exploration of her; and now that
she was inured to him, no longer too frightened to let him
approach, now, moreover, that he had abandoned the
jocular insolences of the Complete Man in favour of a more
native mildness, which he felt instinctively was more
suitable in this particular case, she laid no difficulties in his
way. She was lonely, and he seemed to understand everything
so well; in the unknown country of her spirit and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_181">181</span>her history she was soon going eagerly before him as his
guide.</p>
<p class="c010">She was an orphan. Her mother she hardly remembered.
Her father had died of influenza when she was fifteen. One
of his business friends used to come and see her at school,
take her out for treats and give her chocolates. She used
to call him Uncle Stanley. He was a leather merchant, fat
and jolly with a rather red face, very white teeth and a bald
head that was beautifully shiny. When she was seventeen
and a half he asked her to marry him, and she had said yes.</p>
<p class="c010">“But why?” Gumbril asked. “Why on earth?” he
repeated.</p>
<p class="c010">“He said he’d take me round the world; it was just
when the war had come to an end. Round the world, you
know; and I didn’t like school. I didn’t know anything
about it and he was very nice to me; he was very pressing.
I didn’t know what marriage meant.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Didn’t know?”</p>
<p class="c010">She shook her head; it was quite true. “But not in the
least.”</p>
<p class="c010">And she had been born within the twentieth century.
It seemed a case for the text-books of sexual psychology.
“Mrs. Emily X., born in 1901, was found to be in a state
of perfect innocence and ignorance at the time of the
Armistice, 11th November 1918,” etc.</p>
<p class="c010">“And so you married him?”</p>
<p class="c010">She had nodded.</p>
<p class="c010">“And then?”</p>
<p class="c010">She had covered her face with her hands, she had shuddered.
The amateur uncle, now professionally a husband,
had come to claim his rights—drunk. She had fought him,
she had eluded him, had run away and locked herself into
<span class="pageno" id="Page_182">182</span>another room. On the second night of her honeymoon
he gave her a bruise on the forehead and a bite on the left
breast which had gone on septically festering for weeks.
On the fourth, more determined than ever, he seized her
so violently by the throat, that a blood-vessel broke and
she began coughing bright blood over the bedclothes.
The amateur uncle had been reduced to send for a doctor
and Emily had spent the next few weeks in a nursing home.
That was four years ago; her husband had tried to induce
her to come back, but Emily had refused. She had a little
money of her own; she was able to refuse. The amateur
uncle had consoled himself with other and more docile
nieces.</p>
<p class="c010">“And has nobody tried to make love to you since then?”
he asked.</p>
<p class="c010">“Oh, lots of them have tried.”</p>
<p class="c010">“And not succeeded?”</p>
<p class="c010">She shook her head. “I don’t like men,” she said.
“They’re hateful, most of them. They’re brutes.”</p>
<p class="c010">“<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Anch’ io?</span></i>”</p>
<p class="c010">“What?” she asked, puzzled.</p>
<p class="c010">“Am I a brute too?” And behind his beard, suddenly,
he felt rather a brute.</p>
<p class="c010">“No,” said Emily, after a little hesitation, “you’re
different. At least I think you are; though sometimes,”
she added candidly, “sometimes you do and say things
which make me wonder if you really are different.”</p>
<p class="c010">The Complete Man laughed.</p>
<p class="c010">“Don’t laugh like that,” she said. “It’s rather stupid.”</p>
<p class="c010">“You’re perfectly right,” said Gumbril. “It is.”</p>
<p class="c010">And how did she spend her time? He continued the
exploration.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_183">183</span>Well, she read a lot of books; but most of the novels
she got from Boots’ seemed to her rather silly.</p>
<p class="c010">“Too much about the same thing. Always love.”</p>
<p class="c010">The Complete Man gave a shrug. “Such is life.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Well, it oughtn’t to be,” said Emily.</p>
<p class="c010">And then, when she was in the country—and she was
often in the country, taking lodgings here and there in little
villages, weeks and months at a time—she went for long
walks. Molly couldn’t understand why she liked the
country; but she did. She was very fond of flowers. She
liked them more than people, she thought.</p>
<p class="c010">“I wish I could paint,” she said. “If I could, I’d be
happy for ever, just painting flowers. But I can’t paint.”
She shook her head. “I’ve tried so often. Such dirty,
ugly smudges come out on the paper; and it’s all so lovely
in my head, so lovely out in the fields.”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril began talking with erudition about the flora of
West Surrey: where you could find butterfly orchis and
green man and the bee, the wood where there was actually
wild columbine growing, the best localities for butcher’s
broom, the outcrops of clay where you get wild daffodils.
All this odd knowledge came spouting up into his mind
from some underground source of memory. Flowers—he
never thought about flowers nowadays from one year’s end
to the other. But his mother had liked flowers. Every
spring and summer they used to go down to stay at their
cottage in the country. All their walks, all their drives in
the governess cart had been hunts after flowers. And
naturally the child had hunted with all his mother’s ardour.
He had kept books of pressed flowers, he had mummified
them in hot sand, he had drawn maps of the country and
coloured them elaborately with different coloured inks to
<span class="pageno" id="Page_184">184</span>show where the different flowers grew. How long ago all
that was! Horribly long ago! Many seeds had fallen in
the stony places of his spirit, to spring luxuriantly up into
stalky plants and wither again because they had no deepness
of earth; many had been sown there and had died, since
his mother scattered the seeds of the wild flowers.</p>
<p class="c010">“And if you want sundew,” he wound up, “you’ll find
it in the Punch Bowl, under Hindhead. Or round about
Frensham. The Little Pond, you know, not the Big.”</p>
<p class="c010">“But you know all about them,” Emily exclaimed in
delight. “I’m ashamed of my poor little knowledge. And
you must really love them as much as I do.”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril did not deny it; they were linked henceforth
by a chain of flowers.</p>
<p class="c010">But what else did she do?</p>
<p class="c010">Oh, of course she played the piano a great deal. Very
badly; but at any rate it gave her pleasure. Beethoven:
she liked Beethoven best. More or less, she knew all the
sonatas, though she could never keep up anything like the
right speed in the difficult parts.</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril had again shown himself wonderfully at home.
“Aha!” he said. “I bet you can’t shake that low B in
the last variation but one of Op. 106 so that it doesn’t sound
ridiculous.”</p>
<p class="c010">And of course she couldn’t, and of course she was glad
that he knew all about it and how impossible it was.</p>
<p class="c010">In the cab, as they drove back to Kew that evening, the
Complete Man had decided it was time to do something
decisive. The parting kiss—more of a playful sonorous buss
than a serious embracement—that was already in the protocol,
as signed and sealed before her departure by giggling
Molly. It was time, the Complete Man considered, that
<span class="pageno" id="Page_185">185</span>this salute should take on a character less formal and less
playful. One, two, three and, decisively, as they passed
through Hammersmith Broadway, he risked the gesture.
Emily burst into tears. He was not prepared for that,
though perhaps he should have been. It was only by imploring,
only by almost weeping himself, that Gumbril persuaded
her to revoke her decision never, never to see him
again.</p>
<p class="c010">“I had thought you were different,” she sobbed. “And
now, now——”</p>
<p class="c010">“Please, please,” he entreated. He was on the point of
tearing off his beard and confessing everything there and
then. But that, on second thoughts, would probably only
make things worse.</p>
<p class="c010">“Please, I promise.”</p>
<p class="c010">In the end, she had consented to see him once again,
provisionally, in Kew Gardens, on the following day. They
were to meet at the little temple that stands on the hillock
above the valley of the heathers.</p>
<p class="c010">And now, duly, they had met. The Complete Man had
been left at home in the top right-hand drawer, along with
the ties and collars. She would prefer, he guessed, the
Mild and Melancholy one; he was quite right. She had
thought him ‘sweeter’ at a first glimpse.</p>
<p class="c010">“I forgive you,” he said, and kissed her hand. “I
forgive you.”</p>
<p class="c010">Hand in hand they walked down towards the valley of the
heaths.</p>
<p class="c010">“I don’t know why you should be forgiving me,” she
said, laughing. “It seems to me that I ought to be doing
the forgiving. After yesterday.” She shook her head
at him. “You made me so wretched.”</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_186">186</span>“Ah, but you’ve already done your forgiving.”</p>
<p class="c010">“You seem to take it very much for granted,” said
Emily. “Don’t be too sure.”</p>
<p class="c010">“But I am sure,” said Gumbril. “I can see——”</p>
<p class="c010">Emily laughed again. “I feel happy,” she declared.</p>
<p class="c010">“So do I.”</p>
<p class="c010">“How green the grass is!”</p>
<p class="c010">Green, green—after these long damp months it glowed
in the sunlight, as though it were lighted from inside.</p>
<p class="c010">“And the trees!”</p>
<p class="c010">The pale, high, clot-polled trees of the English spring;
the dark, symmetrical pine trees, islanded here and there on
the lawns, each with its own separate profile against the sky
and its own shadow, impenetrably dark or freckled with
moving lights, on the grass at its feet.</p>
<p class="c010">They walked on in silence. Gumbril took off his hat,
breathed the soft air that smelt of the greenness of the
garden.</p>
<p class="c010">“There are quiet places also in the mind,” he said
meditatively. “But we build bandstands and factories
on them. Deliberately—to put a stop to the quietness.
We don’t like the quietness. All the thoughts, all the preoccupations
in my head—round and round, continually.”
He made a circular motion with his hand. “And the jazz
bands, the music-hall songs, the boys shouting the news.
What’s it for? what’s it all for? To put an end to the quiet,
to break it up and disperse it, to pretend at any cost it
isn’t there. Ah, but it is; it is there, in spite of everything,
at the back of everything. Lying awake at night, sometimes—not
restlessly, but serenely, waiting for sleep—the
quiet re-establishes itself, piece by piece; all the broken
bits, all the fragments of it we’ve been so busily dispersing
<span class="pageno" id="Page_187">187</span>all day long. It re-establishes itself, an inward quiet, like
this outward quiet of grass and trees. It fills one, it grows—a
crystal quiet, a growing, expanding crystal. It grows, it
becomes more perfect; it is beautiful and terrifying, yes,
terrifying as well as beautiful. For one’s alone in the
crystal and there’s no support from outside, there’s nothing
external and important, nothing external and trivial to
pull oneself up by or to stand on, superiorly, contemptuously,
so that one can look down. There’s nothing to laugh at or
feel enthusiastic about. But the quiet grows and grows.
Beautifully and unbearably. And at last you are conscious
of something approaching; it is almost a faint sound of
footsteps. Something inexpressibly lovely and wonderful
advances through the crystal, nearer, nearer. And, oh,
inexpressibly terrifying. For if it were to touch you, if it
were to seize and engulf you, you’d die; all the regular,
habitual, daily part of you would die. There would be an
end of bandstands and whizzing factories, and one would
have to begin living arduously in the quiet, arduously in
some strange, unheard-of manner. Nearer, nearer come the
steps; but one can’t face the advancing thing. One
daren’t. It’s too terrifying, it’s too painful to die. Quickly,
before it is too late, start the factory wheels, bang the drum,
blow up the saxophone. Think of the women you’d like
to sleep with, the schemes for making money, the gossip
about your friends, the last outrage of the politicians.
Anything for a diversion. Break the silence, smash the
crystal to pieces. There, it lies in bits; it is easily broken,
hard to build up and easy to break. And the steps? Ah,
those have taken themselves off, double quick. Double
quick, they were gone at the first flawing of the crystal.
And by this time the lovely and terrifying thing is three
<span class="pageno" id="Page_188">188</span>infinities away, at least. And you lie tranquilly on your
bed, thinking of what you’d do if you had ten thousand
pounds, and of all the fornications you’ll never commit.”
He thought of Rosie’s pink underclothes.</p>
<p class="c010">“You make things very complicated,” she said, after a
silence.</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril spread out his great-coat on a green bank and
they sat down. Leaning back, his hands under his head,
he watched her sitting there beside him. She had taken
off her hat; there was a stir of wind in those childish curls,
and at the nape, at the temples, where the hair had sleaved
out thin and fine, the sunlight made little misty haloes of
gold. Her hands clasped round her knees, she sat quite
still, looking out across the green expanses, at the trees, at
the white clouds on the horizon. There was quiet in her
mind, he thought. She was native to that crystal world;
for her, the steps came comfortingly through the silence
and the lovely thing brought with it no terrors. It was all
so easy for her and simple.</p>
<p class="c010">Ah, so simple, so simple; like the Hire Purchase System
on which Rosie had bought her pink bed. And how simple
it was, too, to puddle clear waters and unpetal every flower!—every
wild flower, by God! one ever passed in a governess
cart at the heels of a barrel-bellied pony. How simple to
spit on the floors of churches! <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Si prega di non sputare.</span></i>
Simple to kick one’s legs and enjoy oneself—dutifully—in
pink underclothing. Perfectly simple.</p>
<p class="c010">“It’s like the Arietta, don’t you think?” said Emily
suddenly, “the Arietta of Op. 111.” And she hummed
the first bars of the air. “Don’t you feel it’s like
that?”</p>
<p class="c010">“What’s like that?”</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_189">189</span>“Everything,” said Emily. “To-day, I mean. You
and me. These gardens——” And she went on humming.</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril shook his head. “Too simple for me,” he said.</p>
<p class="c010">Emily laughed. “Ah, but then think how impossible it
gets a little farther on.” She agitated her fingers wildly,
as though she were trying to play the impossible passages.
“It begins easily for the sake of poor imbeciles like me;
but it goes on, it goes on, more and more fully and subtly
and abstrusely and embracingly. But it’s still the same
movement.”</p>
<p class="c010">The shadows stretched farther and farther across the
lawns, and as the sun declined the level light picked out
among the grasses innumerable stipplings of shadow; and
in the paths, that had seemed under the more perpendicular
rays as level as a table, a thousand little shadowy depressions
and sun-touched mountains were now apparent. Gumbril
looked at his watch.</p>
<p class="c010">“Good Lord!” he said, “we must fly.” He jumped up.
“Quick, quick!”</p>
<p class="c010">“But why?”</p>
<p class="c010">“We shall be late.” He wouldn’t tell her for what.
“Wait and see” was all that Emily could get out of him
by her questioning. They hurried out of the gardens, and
in spite of her protests he insisted on taking a taxi into town.
“I have such a lot of unearned increment to get rid of,”
he explained. The Patent Small-Clothes seemed at the
moment remoter than the farthest stars.</p>
<div class="chapter">
<span class="pageno" id="Page_190">190</span>
<h2 class="c008">CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>
<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c009">In spite of the taxi, in spite of the gobbled dinner, they
were late. The concert had begun.</p>
<p class="c010">“Never mind,” said Gumbril. “We shall get in in
time for the minuetto. It’s then that the fun really begins.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Sour grapes,” said Emily, putting her ear to the door.
“It sounds to me simply too lovely.”</p>
<p class="c010">They stood outside, like beggars waiting abjectly at the
doors of a banqueting-hall—stood and listened to the
snatches of music that came out tantalizingly from within.
A rattle of clapping announced at last that the first movement
was over; the doors were thrown open. Hungrily
they rushed in. The Sclopis Quartet and a subsidiary
viola were bowing from the platform. There was a chirrup
of tuning, then preliminary silence. Sclopis nodded and
moved his bow. The minuetto of Mozart’s G minor
Quintet broke out, phrase after phrase, short and decisive,
with every now and then a violent sforzando chord, startling
in its harsh and sudden emphasis.</p>
<p class="c010">Minuetto—all civilization, Mr. Mercaptan would have
said, was implied in the delicious word, the delicate, pretty
thing. Ladies and precious gentlemen, fresh from the wit
and gallantry of Crebillon-haunted sofas, stepping gracefully
to a pattern of airy notes. To this passion of one who
cries out, to this obscure and angry argument with fate
how would they, Gumbril wondered, how would they have
tripped it?</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_191">191</span>How pure the passion, how unaffected, clear and without
clot or pretension the unhappiness of that slow movement
which followed! Blessed are the pure in heart, for they
shall see God. Pure and unsullied; pure and unmixed,
unadulterated. “Not passionate, thank God; only sensual
and sentimental.” In the name of earwig. Amen. Pure,
pure. Worshippers have tried to rape the statues of the
gods; the statuaries who made the images were generally
to blame. And how deliciously, too, an artist can suffer!
and, in the face of the whole Albert Hall, with what an
effective gesture and grimace! But blessed are the pure
in heart, for they shall see God. The instruments come
together and part again. Long silver threads hang aerially
over a murmur of waters; in the midst of muffled sobbing
a cry. The fountains blow their architecture of slender
pillars, and from basin to basin the waters fall; from basin
to basin, and every fall makes somehow possible a higher
leaping of the jet, and at the last fall the mounting column
springs up into the sunlight, and from water the music has
modulated up into a rainbow. Blessed are the pure in
heart, for they shall see God; they shall make God visible,
too, to other eyes.</p>
<p class="c010">Blood beats in the ears. Beat, beat, beat. A slow drum
in the darkness, beating in the ears of one who lies wakeful
with fever, with the sickness of too much misery. It beats
unceasingly, in the ears, in the mind itself. Body and mind
are indivisible, and in the spirit blood painfully throbs. Sad
thoughts droop through the mind. A small, pure light
comes swaying down through the darkness, comes to rest,
resigning itself to the obscurity of its misfortune. There
is resignation, but blood still beats in the ears. Blood still
painfully beats, though the mind has acquiesced. And
<span class="pageno" id="Page_192">192</span>then, suddenly, the mind exerts itself, throws off the fever
of too much suffering and laughing, commands the body to
dance. The introduction to the last movement comes to
its suspended, throbbing close. There is an instant of
expectation, and then, with a series of mounting trochees
and a downward hurrying, step after tiny step, in triple
time, the dance begins. Irrelevant, irreverent, out of key
with all that has gone before. But man’s greatest strength
lies in his capacity for irrelevance. In the midst of pestilences,
wars and famines, he builds cathedrals; and a slave,
he can think the irrelevant and unsuitable thoughts of a
free man. The spirit is slave to fever and beating blood,
at the mercy of an obscure and tyrannous misfortune. But
irrelevantly, it elects to dance in triple measure—a mounting
skip, a patter of descending feet.</p>
<p class="c010">The G minor Quintet is at an end; the applause rattles
out loudly. Enthusiasts stand up and cry bravo. And the
five men on the platform rise and bow their acknowledgments.
Great Sclopis himself receives his share of the
plaudits with a weary condescension; weary are his poached
eyes, weary his disillusioned smile. It is only his due, he
knows; but he has had so much clapping, so many lovely
women. He has a Roman nose, a colossal brow and, though
the tawny musical mane does much to conceal the fact,
no back to his head. Garofalo, the second fiddle, is black,
beady-eyed and pot-bellied. The convex reflections of the
electroliers slide back and forth over his polished bald head,
as he bends, again, again, in little military salutes. Peperkoek,
two metres high, bows with a sinuous politeness. His
face, his hair are all of the same greyish buff colour; he
does not smile, his appearance is monolithic and grim. Not
so exuberant Knoedler, who sweats and smiles and embraces
<span class="pageno" id="Page_193">193</span>his ’cello send lays his hand to his heart and bows almost to
the ground as though all this hullabaloo were directed only
at him. As for poor little Mr. Jenkins, the subsidiary
viola, he has slid away into the background, and feeling
that this is really the Sclopis’s show and that he, a mere
intruder, has no right to any of these demonstrations, he
hardly bows at all, but only smiles, vaguely and nervously,
and from time to time makes a little spasmodic twitch to
show that he isn’t really ungrateful or haughty, as you
might think, but that he feels in the circumstances—the
position is a little embarrassing—it is hard to explain....</p>
<p class="c010">“Strange,” said Gumbril, “to think that those ridiculous
creatures could have produced what we’ve just been
hearing.”</p>
<p class="c010">The poached eye of Sclopis lighted on Emily, flushed and
ardently applauding. He gave her, all to herself, a weary
smile. He would have a letter, he guessed, to-morrow
morning signed ‘Your little Admirer in the Third Row.’
She looked a choice little piece. He smiled again to encourage
her. Emily, alas! had not even noticed. She was
applauding the music.</p>
<p class="c010">“Did you enjoy it?” he asked, as they stepped out into
a deserted Bond Street.</p>
<p class="c010">“Did I...?” Emily laughed expressively. “No, I
didn’t enjoy,” she said. “Enjoy isn’t the word. You
enjoy eating ices. It made me happy. It’s unhappy
music, but it made me happy.”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril hailed a cab and gave the address of his rooms
in Great Russell Street. “Happy,” he repeated, as they
sat there side by side in the darkness. He, too, was happy.</p>
<p class="c010">“Where are we going?” she asked.</p>
<p class="c010">“To my rooms,” said Gumbril, “we shall be quiet there.”
<span class="pageno" id="Page_194">194</span>He was afraid she might object to going there—after yesterday.
But she made no comment.</p>
<p class="c010">“Some people think that it’s only possible to be happy
if one makes a noise,” she said, after a pause. “I find it’s
too delicate and melancholy for noise. Being happy is
rather melancholy—like the most beautiful landscape, like
those trees and the grass and the clouds and the sunshine
to-day.”</p>
<p class="c010">“From the outside,” said Gumbril, “it even looks rather
dull.” They stumbled up the dark staircase to his rooms.
Gumbril lit a pair of candles and put the kettle on the gas
ring. They sat together on the divan sipping tea. In the
rich, soft light of the candles she looked different, more
beautiful. The silk of her dress seemed wonderfully rich
and glossy, like the petals of a tulip, and on her face, on her
bare arms and neck the light seemed to spread an impalpable
bright bloom. On the wall behind them, their shadows
ran up towards the ceiling, enormous and profoundly black.</p>
<p class="c010">“How unreal it is,” Gumbril whispered. “Not true.
This remote secret room. These lights and shadows out of
another time. And you out of nowhere and I, out of a past
utterly remote from yours, sitting together here, together—and
being happy. That’s the strangest thing of all.
Being quite senselessly happy. It’s unreal, unreal.”</p>
<p class="c010">“But why,” said Emily, “why? It’s here and happening
now. It <em>is</em> real.”</p>
<p class="c010">“It all might vanish, at any moment,” he said.</p>
<p class="c010">Emily smiled rather sadly. “It’ll vanish in due time,”
she said. “Quite naturally, not by magic; it’ll vanish the
way everything else vanishes and changes. But it’s here
now.”</p>
<p class="c010">They gave themselves up to the enchantment. The
<span class="pageno" id="Page_195">195</span>candles burned, two shining eyes of flame, without a wink,
minute after minute. But for them there were no longer
any minutes. Emily leaned against him, her body held in
the crook of his arm, her head resting on his shoulder. He
caressed his cheek against her hair; sometimes, very gently,
he kissed her forehead or her closed eyes.</p>
<p class="c010">“If I had known you years ago ...” she sighed. “But
I was a silly little idiot then. I shouldn’t have noticed any
difference between you and anybody else.”</p>
<p class="c010">“I shall be very jealous,” Emily spoke again after another
timeless silence. “There must never be anybody else,
never the shadow of anybody else.”</p>
<p class="c010">“There never will be anybody else,” said Gumbril.</p>
<p class="c010">Emily smiled and opened her eyes, looked up at him.
“Ah, not here,” she said, “not in this real unreal room.
Not during this eternity. But there will be other rooms
just as real as this.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Not so real, not so real.” He bent his face towards
hers. She closed her eyes again, and the lids fluttered with
a sudden tremulous movement at the touch of his light
kiss.</p>
<p class="c010">For them there were no more minutes. But time passed,
time passed flowing in a dark stream, stanchlessly, as though
from some profound mysterious wound in the world’s side,
bleeding, bleeding for ever. One of the candles had burned
down to the socket and the long, smoky flame wavered
unsteadily. The flickering light troubled their eyes; the
shadows twitched and stirred uneasily. Emily looked up
at him.</p>
<p class="c010">“What’s the time?” she said.</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril looked at his watch. It was nearly one o’clock.
“Too late for you to get back,” he said.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_196">196</span>“Too late?” Emily sat-up. Ah, the enchantment was
breaking, was giving way, like a film of ice beneath a weight,
like a web before a thrust of the wind. They looked at one
another. “What shall I do?” she asked.</p>
<p class="c010">“You could sleep here,” Gumbril answered in a voice
that came from a long way away.</p>
<p class="c010">She sat for a long time in silence, looking through half-closed
eyes at the expiring candle flame. Gumbril watched
her in an agony of suspense. Was the ice to be broken,
the web-work finally and for ever torn? The enchantment
could still be prolonged, the eternity renewed. He
felt his heart beating in his breast; he held his breath.
It would be terrible if she were to go now, it would be a
kind of death. The flame of the candle flickered more
violently, leaping up in a thin, long, smoky flare, sinking
again almost to darkness. Emily got up and blew out the
candle. The other still burned calmly and steadily.</p>
<p class="c010">“May I stay?” she asked. “Will you allow me?”</p>
<p class="c010">He understood the meaning of her question, and nodded.
“Of course,” he said.</p>
<p class="c010">“Of course? Is it as much of course as all that?”</p>
<p class="c010">“When I say so.” He smiled at her. The eternity had
been renewed, the enchantment prolonged. There was no
need to think of anything now but the moment. The
past was forgotten, the future abolished. There was only
this secret room and the candlelight and the unreal, impossible
happiness of being two. Now that this peril of a
disenchantment had been averted, it would last for ever.
He got up from the couch, crossed the room, he took her
hands and kissed them.</p>
<p class="c010">“Shall we sleep now?” she asked.</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril nodded.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_197">197</span>“Do you mind if I blow out the light?” And without
waiting for his answer, Emily turned, gave a puff, and the
room was in darkness. He heard the rustling of her undressing.
Hastily he stripped off his own clothes, pulled
back the coverlet from the divan. The bed was made and
ready; he opened it and slipped between the sheets. A
dim greenish light from the gas lamp in the street below
came up between the parted curtains illuminating faintly
the farther end of the room. Against this tempered darkness
he could see her, silhouetted, standing quite still, as if
hesitating on some invisible brink.</p>
<p class="c010">“Emily,” he whispered.</p>
<p class="c010">“I’m coming,” Emily answered. She stood there, unmoving,
a few seconds longer, then overstepped the brink.
She came silently across the room, and sat down on the
edge of the low couch. Gumbril lay perfectly still, without
speaking, waiting in the enchanted timeless darkness. Emily
lifted her knees, slid her feet in under the sheet, then
stretched herself out beside him, her body, in the narrow
bed, touching his. Gumbril felt that she was trembling;
trembling, a sharp involuntary start, a little shudder,
another start.</p>
<p class="c010">“You’re cold,” he said, and slipping one arm beneath her
shoulders he drew her, limp and unresisting, towards him.
She lay there, pressed against him. Gradually the trembling
ceased. Quite still, quite still in the calm of the enchantment.
The past is forgotten, the future abolished; there
is only this dark and everlasting moment. A drugged and
intoxicated stupor of happiness possessed his spirit; a
numbness, warm and delicious, lay upon him. And yet
through the stupor he knew with a dreadful anxious certainty
that the end would soon be there. Like a man on
<span class="pageno" id="Page_198">198</span>the night before his execution, he looked forward through
the endless present; he foresaw the end of his eternity.
And after? Everything was uncertain and unsafe.</p>
<p class="c010">Very gently, he began caressing her shoulder, her long
slender arm, drawing his finger-tips lightly and slowly over
her smooth skin; slowly from her neck, over her shoulder,
lingeringly round the elbow to her hand. Again, again;
he was learning her arm. The form of it was part of the
knowledge, now, of his finger-tips; his fingers knew it as
they knew a piece of music, as they knew Mozart’s Twelfth
Sonata, for example. And the themes that crowd so
quickly one after another at the beginning of the first
movement played themselves serially, glitteringly in his
mind; they became a part of the enchantment.</p>
<p class="c010">Through the silk of her shift he learned her curving side,
her smooth straight back and the ridge of her spine. He
stretched down, touched her feet, her knees. Under the
smock he learned her warm body, lightly, slowly caressing.
He knew her, his fingers, he felt, could build her up, a
warm and curving statue in the darkness. He did not desire
her; to desire would have been to break the enchantment.
He let himself sink deeper and deeper into his dark stupor
of happiness. She was asleep in his arms; and soon he too
was asleep.</p>

<h2 class="c008">CHAPTER XIV</h2>
</div>
<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c009">Mrs. Viveash descended the steps into King
Street, and standing there on the pavement looked
dubiously first to the right and then to the left.
Little and loud, the taxis rolled by on their white wheels,
the long-snouted limousines passed with a sigh. The air
smelt of watered dust, tempered in Mrs. Viveash’s immediate
neighbourhood by those memories of Italian jasmines
which were her perfume. On the opposite pavement, in
the shade, two young men, looking very conscious of their
grey top-hats, marched gravely along.</p>
<p class="c010">Life, Mrs. Viveash thought, looked a little dim this
morning, in spite of the fine weather. She glanced at her
watch; it was one o’clock. Soon one would have to eat
some lunch. But where, and with whom? Mrs. Viveash
had no engagements. All the world was before her, she
was absolutely free, all day long. Yesterday, when she
declined all those pressing invitations, the prospect had
seemed delightful. Liberty, no complications, no contacts;
a pre-Adamite empty world to do what she liked
in.</p>
<p class="c010">But to-day, when it came to the point, she hated her
liberty. To come out like this at one o’clock into a vacuum—it
was absurd, it was appalling. The prospect of immeasurable
boredom opened before her. Steppes after
steppes of ennui, horizon beyond horizon, for ever the
same. She looked again to the right and again to the left.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_200">200</span>Finally she decided to go to the left. Slowly, walking
along her private knife-edge between her personal abysses,
she walked towards the left. She remembered suddenly
one shining day like this in the summer of 1917, when she
had walked along this same street, slowly, like this, on the
sunny side, with Tony Lamb. All that day, that night,
it had been one long good-bye. He was going back the
next morning. Less than a week later he was dead. Never
again, never again: there had been a time when she could
make herself cry, simply by saying those two words once or
twice, under her breath. Never again, never again. She
repeated them softly now. But she felt no tears behind
her eyes. Grief doesn’t kill, love doesn’t kill; but time
kills everything, kills desire, kills sorrow, kills in the end the
mind that feels them; wrinkles and softens the body while
it still lives, rots it like a medlar, kills it too at last. Never
again, never again. Instead of crying, she laughed, laughed
aloud. The pigeon-breasted old gentleman who had just
passed her, twirling between his finger and thumb the ends
of a white military moustache, turned round startled.
Could she be laughing at him?</p>
<p class="c010">“Never again,” murmured Mrs. Viveash.</p>
<p class="c010">“I beg your pardon?” queried the martial gentleman,
in a rich, port-winey, cigary voice.</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Viveash looked at him with such wide-eyed astonishment
that the old gentleman was quite taken aback. “A
thousand apologies, dear lady. Thought you were addressing ...
H’m, ah’m.” He replaced his hat, squared his
shoulders and went off smartly, left, right, bearing preciously
before him his pigeon-breast. Poor thing, he
thought, poor young thing. Talking to herself. Must be
cracked, must be off her head. Or perhaps she took drugs.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_201">201</span>That was more likely: that was much more likely. Most
of them did nowadays. Vicious young women. Lesbians,
drug-fiends, nymphomaniacs, dipsos—thoroughly vicious,
nowadays, thoroughly vicious. He arrived at his club in
an excellent temper.</p>
<p class="c010">Never again, never, never again. Mrs. Viveash would
have liked to be able to cry.</p>
<p class="c010">St. James’s Square opened before her. Romantically
under its trees the statue pranced. The trees gave her an
idea: she might go down into the country for the afternoon,
take a cab and drive out, out, goodness only knew
where! To the top of a hill somewhere. Box Hill, Leith
Hill, Holmbury Hill, Ivinghoe Beacon—any hill where one
could sit and look out over plains. One might do worse
than that with one’s liberty.</p>
<p class="c010">But not much worse, she reflected.</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Viveash had turned up towards the northern side
of the square and was almost at its north-western corner
when, with a thrill of genuine delight, with a sense of the
most profound relief she saw a familiar figure, running down
the steps of the London Library.</p>
<p class="c010">“Theodore!” she hallooed faintly but penetratingly,
from her inward death-bed. “Gumbril!” She waved
her parasol.</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril halted, looked round, came smiling to meet her.
“How delightful,” he said, “but how unfortunate.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Why unfortunate?” asked Mrs. Viveash. “Am I of
evil omen?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Unfortunate,” Gumbril explained, “because I’ve got
to catch a train and can’t profit by this meeting.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Ah no, Theodore,” said Mrs. Viveash, “you’re not
going to catch a train. You’re going to come and lunch
<span class="pageno" id="Page_202">202</span>with me. Providence has decreed it. You can’t say no to
Providence.”</p>
<p class="c010">“I must,” Gumbril shook his head. “I’ve said yes to
somebody else.”</p>
<p class="c010">“To whom?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Ah!” said Gumbril, with a coy and saucy mysteriousness.</p>
<p class="c010">“And where are you going in your famous train?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Ah again,” Gumbril answered.</p>
<p class="c010">“How intolerably tiresome and silly you are!” Mrs.
Viveash declared. “One would think you were a sixteen-year-old
schoolboy going out for his first assignation with
a shop girl. At your age, Gumbril!” She shook her head,
smiled agonizingly and with contempt. “Who is she?
What sordid pick-up?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Not sordid in the least,” protested Gumbril.</p>
<p class="c010">“But decidedly a pick-up. Eh?” A banana-skin was
lying, like a bedraggled starfish, in the gutter, just in front
of where they were standing. Mrs. Viveash stepped
forward and with the point of her parasol lifted it carefully
up and offered it to her companion.</p>
<p class="c010">“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Merci</span></i>,” Gumbril bowed.</p>
<p class="c010">She tossed the skin back again into the gutter. “In any
case,” she said, “the young lady can wait while we have
luncheon.”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril shook his head. “I’ve made the arrangement,”
he said. Emily’s letter was in his pocket. She had taken
the loveliest cottage just out of Robertsbridge, in Sussex.
Ah, but the loveliest imaginable. For the whole summer.
He could come and see her there. He had telegraphed
that he would come to-day, this afternoon, by the two
o’clock from Charing Cross.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_203">203</span>Mrs. Viveash took him by the elbow. “Come along,”
she said. “There’s a post office in that passage going from
Jermyn Street to Piccadilly. You can wire from there your
infinite regrets. These things always improve with a little
keeping. There will be raptures when you <em>do</em> go to-morrow.”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril allowed himself to be led along. “What an
insufferable woman you are,” he said, laughing.</p>
<p class="c010">“Instead of being grateful to me for asking you to
luncheon!”</p>
<p class="c010">“Oh, I am grateful,” said Gumbril. “And astonished.”</p>
<p class="c010">He looked at her. Mrs. Viveash smiled and fixed him
for a moment with her pale, untroubled eyes.... She
said nothing.</p>
<p class="c010">“Still,” Gumbril went on, “I must be at Charing Cross
by two, you know.”</p>
<p class="c010">“But we’re lunching at Verrey’s.”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril shook his head.</p>
<p class="c010">They were at the corner of Jermyn Street. Mrs. Viveash
halted and delivered her ultimatum, the more impressive
for being spoken in that expiring voice of one who says <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in
articulo</span></i> the final and supremely important things. “We
lunch at Verrey’s, Theodore, or I shall never, never speak
to you again.”</p>
<p class="c010">“But be reasonable, Myra,” he implored. If only he’d
told her that he had a business appointment.... Imbecile,
to have dropped those stupid hints—in that tone!</p>
<p class="c010">“I prefer not to be,” said Mrs. Viveash.</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril made a gesture of despair and was silent. He
thought of Emily in her native quiet among the flowers; in
a cottage altogether too cottagey, with honeysuckles and
red ramblers and hollyhocks—though, on second thoughts,
none of them would be blooming yet, would they?—happily,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_204">204</span>in white muslin, extracting from the cottage piano the
easier sections of the Arietta. A little absurd, perhaps,
when you considered her like that; but exquisite, but
adorable, but pure of heart and flawless in her bright
pellucid integrity, complete as a crystal in its faceted perfection.
She would be waiting for him, expecting him;
and they would walk through the twiddly lanes—or perhaps
there would be a governess cart for hire, with a fat pony
like a tub on legs to pull it—they would look for flowers in
the woods and perhaps he would still remember what sort
of noise a whitethroat makes; or even if he didn’t remember,
he could always magisterially say he did. “That’s a whitethroat,
Emily. Do you hear? The one that goes ‘Tweedly,
weedly, weedledy dee.’”</p>
<p class="c010">“I’m waiting,” said Mrs. Viveash. “Patiently, however.”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril looked at her and found her smiling like a tragic
mask. After all, he reflected, Emily would still be there if
he went down to-morrow. It would be stupid to quarrel
with Myra about something that was really, when he came
to think of it, not of enormous importance. It was stupid
to quarrel with any one about anything; and with Myra
and about this, particularly so. In this white dress patterned
with flowing arabesques of black she looked, he thought,
more than ever enchanting. There had been times in
the past.... The past leads on to the present.... No;
but in any case she was excellent company.</p>
<p class="c010">“Well,” he said, sighing decisively, “let’s go and send
my wire.”</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Viveash made no comment, and traversing Jermyn
Street they walked up the narrow passage under the lee of
Wren’s bald barn of St. James’s, to the post office.</p>
<p class="c010">“I shall pretext a catastrophe,” said Gumbril, as they
<span class="pageno" id="Page_205">205</span>entered; and going to the telegraph desk he wrote: “Slight
accident on way to station not serious at all but a little
indisposed come same train to-morrow.” He addressed
the form and handed it in.</p>
<p class="c010">“A little what?” asked the young lady behind the bars,
as she read it through, prodding each successive word with
the tip of her blunt pencil.</p>
<p class="c010">“A little indisposed,” said Gumbril, and he felt suddenly
very much ashamed of himself. “A little indisposed,”—no,
really, that was too much. He’d withdraw the telegram,
he’d go after all.</p>
<p class="c010">“Ready?” asked Mrs. Viveash, coming up from the
other end of the counter where she had been buying stamps.</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril pushed a florin under the bars.</p>
<p class="c010">“A little indisposed,” he said, hooting with laughter, and
he walked towards the door leaning heavily on his stick
and limping. “Slight accident,” he explained.</p>
<p class="c010">“What is the meaning of this clownery?” Mrs. Viveash
inquired.</p>
<p class="c010">“What indeed?” Gumbril had limped up to the door
and stood there, holding it open for her. He was taking no
responsibility for himself. It was the clown’s doing, and
the clown, poor creature, was <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">non compos</span></i>, not entirely
there, and couldn’t be called to account for his actions. He
limped after her towards Piccadilly.</p>
<p class="c010">“<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giudicato guarabile in cinque giorni</span></i>,” Mrs. Viveash
laughed. “How charming that always is in the Italian
papers. The fickle lady, the jealous lover, the stab, the
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">colpo di rivoltella</span></i>, the mere Anglo-Saxon black eye—all
judged by the house surgeon at the Misericordia curable
in five days. And you, my poor Gumbril, are you curable
in five days?”</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_206">206</span>“That depends,” said Gumbril. “There may be complications.”</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Viveash waved her parasol; a taxi came swerving
to the pavement’s edge in front of them. “Meanwhile,”
she said, “you can’t be expected to walk.”</p>
<p class="c010">At Verrey’s they lunched off lobsters and white wine.
“Fish suppers,” Gumbril quoted jovially from the Restoration,
“fish suppers will make a man hop like a flea.”
Through the whole meal he clowned away in the most
inimitable style. The ghost of a governess cart rolled along
the twiddly lanes of Robertsbridge. But one can refuse
to accept responsibility; a clown cannot be held accountable.
And besides, when the future and the past are
abolished, when it is only the present instant, whether
enchanted or unenchanted, that counts, when there are no
causes or motives, no future consequences to be considered,
how can there be responsibility, even for those who are
not clowns? He drank a great deal of hock, and when the
clock struck two and the train had begun to snort out of
Charing Cross, he could not refrain from proposing the
health of Viscount Lascelles. After that he began telling
Mrs. Viveash about his adventure as a Complete Man.</p>
<p class="c010">“You should have seen me,” he said, describing his
beard.</p>
<p class="c010">“I should have been bowled over.”</p>
<p class="c010">“You shall see me, then,” said Gumbril. “Ah, what a
Don Giovanni. <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">La ci darem la mano, La mi dirai di si,
Vieni, non e lontano, Partiam, ben mio, da qui.</span></i> And they
came, they came. Without hesitation. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">No ‘<em>vorrei e
non vorrei</em>,’ no ‘<em>mi trema un poco il cor</em>.’</span> Straight away.”</p>
<p class="c010">“<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Felice, io so, sarei</span></i>,” Mrs. Viveash sang very faintly
under her breath, from a remote bed of agony.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_207">207</span>Ah, happiness, happiness; a little dull, some one had
wisely said, when you looked at it from outside. An affair
of duets at the cottage piano, of collecting specimens, hand
in hand, for the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">hortus siccus</span></i>. A matter of integrity and
quietness.</p>
<p class="c010">“Ah, but the history of the young woman who was
married four years ago,” exclaimed Gumbril with clownish
rapture, “and remains to this day a virgin—what an episode
in my memoirs!” In the enchanted darkness he had
learned her young body. He looked at his fingers; her
beauty was a part of their knowledge. On the tablecloth
he drummed out the first bars of the Twelfth Sonata of
Mozart. “And even after singing her duet with the Don,”
he continued, “she is still virgin. There are chaste
pleasures, sublimated sensualities. More thrillingly voluptuous,”
with the gesture of a restaurant-keeper who
praises the speciality of the house, he blew a treacly kiss,
“than any of the grosser deliriums.”</p>
<p class="c010">“What is all this about?” asked Mrs. Viveash.</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril finished off his glass. “I am talking esoterically,”
he said, “for my own pleasure, not yours.”</p>
<p class="c010">“But tell me more about the beard,” Mrs. Viveash
insisted. “I liked the beard so much.”</p>
<p class="c010">“All right,” said Gumbril, “let us try to be unworthy
with coherence.”</p>
<p class="c010">They sat for a long time over their cigarettes; it was half
past three before Mrs. Viveash suggested they should go.</p>
<p class="c010">“Almost time,” she said, looking at her watch, “to have
tea. One damned meal after another. And never anything
new to eat. And every year one gets bored with
another of the old things. Lobster, for instance, how I
used to adore lobster once! But to-day—well, really,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_208">208</span>it was only your conversation, Theodore, that made it
tolerable.”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril put his hand to his heart and bowed. He felt
suddenly extremely depressed.</p>
<p class="c010">“And wine: I used to think Orvieto so heavenly. But
this spring, when I went to Italy, it was just a bad muddy
sort of Vouvray. And those soft caramels they call Fiats;
I used to eat those till I was sick. I was at the sick stage
before I’d finished one of them, this time in Rome.” Mrs.
Viveash shook her head. “Disillusion after disillusion.”</p>
<p class="c010">They walked down the dark passage into the street.</p>
<p class="c010">“We’ll go home,” said Mrs. Viveash. “I really haven’t
the spirit to do anything else this afternoon.” To the
commissionaire who opened the door of the cab she gave
the address of her house in St. James’s.</p>
<p class="c010">“Will one ever recapture the old thrills?” she asked
rather fatiguedly as they drove slowly through the traffic
of Regent Street.</p>
<p class="c010">“Not by chasing after them,” said Gumbril, in whom the
clown had quite evaporated. “If one sat still enough they
might perhaps come back of their own accord....” There
would be the faint sound as it were of feet approaching
through the quiet.</p>
<p class="c010">“It isn’t only food,” said Mrs. Viveash, who had closed
her eyes and was leaning back in her corner.</p>
<p class="c010">“So I can well believe.”</p>
<p class="c010">“It’s everything. Nothing’s the same now. I feel it
never will be.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Never more,” croaked Gumbril.</p>
<p class="c010">“Never again,” Mrs. Viveash echoed. “Never again.”
There were still no tears behind her eyes. “Did you ever
know Tony Lamb?” she asked.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_209">209</span>“No,” Gumbril answered from his corner. “What
about him?”</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Viveash did not answer. What, indeed, about him?
She thought of his very clear blue eyes and the fair, bright
hair that had been lighter than his brown face. Brown
face and neck, red-brown hands; and all the rest of his
skin was as white as milk. “I was very fond of him,” she
said at last. “That’s all. He was killed in 1917, just
about this time of the year. It seems a very long time ago,
don’t you think?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Does it?” Gumbril shrugged his shoulders. “I
don’t know. The past is abolished. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vivamus, mea Lesbia.</span></i>
If I weren’t so horribly depressed, I’d embrace you. That
would be some slight compensation for my”—he tapped
his foot with the end of his walking-stick—“my accident.”</p>
<p class="c010">“You’re depressed too?”</p>
<p class="c010">“One should never drink at luncheon,” said Gumbril.
“It wrecks the afternoon. One should also never think of
the past and never for one moment consider the future.
These are treasures of ancient wisdom. But perhaps after
a little tea——” He leaned forward to look at the figures
on the taximeter, for the cab had come to a standstill—“after
a nip of the tannin stimulant”—he threw open the
door—“we may feel rather better.”</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Viveash smiled excruciatingly. “For me,” she said,
as she stepped out on to the pavement, “even tannin has
lost its virtues now.”</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Viveash’s drawing-room was tastefully in the movement.
The furniture was upholstered in fabrics designed
by Dufy—racehorses and roses, little tennis players clustering
in the midst of enormous flowers, printed in grey and ochre
on a white ground. There were a couple of lamp-shades
<span class="pageno" id="Page_210">210</span>by Balla. On the pale rose-stippled walls hung three
portraits of herself by three different and entirely incongruous
painters, a selection of the usual oranges and lemons,
and a rather forbidding contemporary nude painted in two
tones of green.</p>
<p class="c010">“And how bored I am with this room and all these
beastly pictures!” exclaimed Mrs. Viveash as she entered.
She took off her hat and, standing in front of the mirror
above the mantelpiece, smoothed her coppery hair.</p>
<p class="c010">“You should take a cottage in the country,” said Gumbril,
“buy a pony and a governess cart and drive along the
twiddly lanes looking for flowers. After tea you open the
cottage piano,” and suiting his action to the words, Gumbril
sat down at the long-tailed Blüthner, “and you play, you
play.” Very slowly and with parodied expressiveness he
played the opening theme of the Arietta. “You wouldn’t
be bored then,” he said, turning round to her, when he
had finished.</p>
<p class="c010">“Ah, wouldn’t I!” said Mrs. Viveash. “And with
whom do you propose that I should share my cottage?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Any one you like,” said Gumbril. His fingers hung, as
though meditating over the keys.</p>
<p class="c010">“But I don’t like any one,” cried Mrs. Viveash with a
terrible vehemence from her death-bed.... Ah, now it
had been said, the truth. It sounded like a joke. Tony
had been dead five years now. Those bright blue eyes—ah,
never again. All rotted away to nothing.</p>
<p class="c010">“Then you should try,” said Gumbril, whose hands had
begun to creep softly forward into the Twelfth Sonata.
“You should try.”</p>
<p class="c010">“But I do try,” said Mrs. Viveash. Her elbows propped
on the mantelpiece, her chin resting on her clasped hands,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_211">211</span>she was looking fixedly at her own image in the glass. Pale
eyes looked unwaveringly into pale eyes. The red mouth
and its reflection exchanged their smiles of pain. She had
tried; it revolted her now to think how often she had tried;
she had tried to like some one, any one, as much as Tony.
She had tried to recapture, to re-evoke, to revivify. And
there had never been anything, really, but a disgust. “I
haven’t succeeded,” she added, after a pause.</p>
<p class="c010">The music had shifted from F major to D minor; it
mounted in leaping anapæsts to a suspended chord, ran
down again, mounted once more, modulating to C minor,
then, through a passage of trembling notes to A flat major,
to the dominant of D flat, to the dominant of C, to C minor,
and at last, to a new clear theme in the major.</p>
<p class="c010">“Then I’m sorry for you,” said Gumbril, allowing his
fingers to play on by themselves. He felt sorry, too, for
the subjects of Mrs. Viveash’s desperate experiments. She
mightn’t have succeeded in liking them—for their part,
poor devils, they in general only too agonizingly liked her....
Only too.... He remembered the cold, damp spots on
his pillow, in the darkness. Those hopeless, angry tears.
“You nearly killed me once,” he said.</p>
<p class="c010">“Only time kills,” said Mrs. Viveash, still looking into
her own pale eyes. “I have never made any one happy,”
she added, after a pause. “Never any one,” she thought,
except Tony, and Tony they had killed, shot him through
the head. Even the bright eyes had rotted, like any other
carrion. She too had been happy then. Never again.</p>
<p class="c010">A maid came in with the tea-things.</p>
<p class="c010">“Ah, the tannin!” exclaimed Gumbril with enthusiasm,
and broke off his playing. “The one hope of salvation.”
He poured out two cups, and picking up one of them he came
<span class="pageno" id="Page_212">212</span>over to the fireplace and stood behind her, sipping slowly
at the pale brewage and looking over her shoulder at their
two reflections in the mirror.</p>
<p class="c010">“<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">La ci darem</span></i>,” he hummed. “If only I had my beard!”
He stroked his chin and with the tip of his forefinger brushed
up the drooping ends of his moustache. “You’d come
trembling like Zerlina, in under its golden shadow.”</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Viveash smiled. “I don’t ask for anything better,”
she said. “What more delightful part! <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Felice, io so,
sarei: Batti, batti, o bel Mazetto.</span></i> Enviable Zerlina!”</p>
<p class="c010">The servant made another silent entry.</p>
<p class="c010">“A gentleman,” she said, “called Mr. Shearwater would
like——”</p>
<p class="c010">“Tell him I’m not at home,” said Mrs. Viveash, without
looking round.</p>
<p class="c010">There was a silence. With raised eyebrows Gumbril
looked over Mrs. Viveash’s shoulder at her reflection. Her
eyes were calm and without expression, she did not smile
or frown. Gumbril still questioningly looked. In the end
he began to laugh.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c009">They were playing that latest novelty from across
the water, “What’s he to Hecuba?” Sweet,
sweet and piercing, the saxophone pierced into
the very bowels of compassion and tenderness, pierced
like a revelation from heaven, pierced like the angel’s treacly
dart into the holy Teresa’s quivering and ecstasiated flank.
More ripely and roundly, with a kindly and less agonizing
voluptuousness, the ’cello meditated those Mohammedan
ecstasies that last, under the green palms of Paradise, six
hundred inenarrable years apiece. Into this charged
atmosphere the violin admitted refreshing draughts of
fresh air, cool and thin like the breath from a still damp
squirt. And the piano hammered and rattled away unmindful
of the sensibilities of the other instruments, banged
away all the time reminding every one concerned, in a
thoroughly business-like way, that this was a cabaret where
people came to dance the fox-trot; not a baroque church
for female saints to go into ecstasies in, not a mild, happy
valley of tumbling houris.</p>
<p class="c010">At each recurrence of the refrain the four negroes of the
orchestra, or at least the three of them who played with
their hands alone—for the saxophonist always blew at this
point with a redoubled sweetness, enriching the passage
with a warbling contrapuntal soliloquy that fairly wrung
the entrails and transported the pierced heart—broke into
melancholy and drawling song:</p>
<div class="lg-container-b c011">
<div class="linegroup">
<div class="group">
<div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_214">214</span>“What’s he to Hecuba?</div>
<div class="line">Nothing at all.</div>
<div class="line">That’s why there’ll be no wedding on Wednesday week,</div>
<div class="line">Way down in old Bengal.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="c010">“What unspeakable sadness,” said Gumbril, as he stepped,
stepped through the intricacies of the trot. “Eternal
passion, eternal pain. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les chants désesperés sont les chants
les plus beaux, Et j’en sais d’immortels qui sont de purs sanglots.</span></i>
Rum tiddle-um-tum, pom-pom. Amen. What’s he to
Hecuba? Nothing at all. Nothing, mark you. Nothing,
nothing.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Nothing,” repeated Mrs. Viveash. “I know all about
that.” She sighed.</p>
<p class="c010">“I am nothing to you,” said Gumbril, gliding with skill
between the wall and the Charybdis of a couple dangerously
experimenting with a new step. “You are nothing to me.
Thank God. And yet here we are, two bodies with but a
single thought, a beast with two backs, a perfectly united
centaur trotting, trotting.” They trotted.</p>
<p class="c010">“What’s he to Hecuba?” The grinning blackamoors
repeated the question, reiterated the answer on a tone of
frightful unhappiness. The saxophone warbled on the
verge of anguish. The couples revolved, marked time,
stepped and stepped with an habitual precision, as though
performing some ancient and profoundly significant rite.
Some were in fancy dress, for this was a gala night at the
cabaret. Young women disguised as callipygous Florentine
pages, blue-breeched Gondoliers, black-breeched Toreadors
circulated, moon-like, round the hall, clasped sometimes
in the arms of Arabs, or white clowns, or more often of
untravestied partners. The faces reflected in the mirrors
<span class="pageno" id="Page_215">215</span>were the sort of faces one feels one ought to know by sight;
the cabaret was ‘Artistic.’</p>
<p class="c010">“What’s he to Hecuba?”</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Viveash murmured the response, almost piously,
as though she were worshipping almighty and omnipresent
Nil. “I adore this tune,” she said, “this divine tune.”
It filled up a space, it moved, it jigged, it set things twitching
in you, it occupied time, it gave you a sense of being alive.
“Divine tune, divine tune,” she repeated with emphasis,
and she shut her eyes, trying to abandon herself, trying to
float, trying to give Nil the slip.</p>
<p class="c010">“Ravishing little Toreador, that,” said Gumbril, who
had been following the black-breeched travesty with
affectionate interest.</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Viveash opened her eyes. Nil was unescapable.
“With Piers Cotton, you mean? Your tastes are a little
common, my dear Theodore.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Green-eyed monster!”</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Viveash laughed. “When I was being ‘finished’
in Paris,” she said, “Mademoiselle always used to urge me
to take fencing lessons. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C’est un exercice très gracieux.
Et puis</span></i>,” Mrs. Viveash mimicked a passionate earnestness,
“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">et puis, ça dévelope le bassin</span></i>. Your Toreador, Gumbril,
looks as though she must be a champion with the foils.
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quel bassin!</span></i>”</p>
<p class="c010">“Hush,” said Gumbril. They were abreast of the
Toreador and her partner. Piers Cotton turned his long
greyhound’s nose in their direction.</p>
<p class="c010">“How are you?” he asked across the music.</p>
<p class="c010">They nodded. “And you?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Ah, writing such a book,” cried Piers Cotton, “such a
brilliant, brilliant, flashing book.” The dance was carrying
<span class="pageno" id="Page_216">216</span>them apart. “Like a smile of false teeth,” he shouted
across the widening gulf, and disappeared in the crowd.</p>
<p class="c010">“What’s he to Hecuba?” Lachrymosely, the hilarious
blackamoors chanted their question, mournfully pregnant
with its foreknown reply.</p>
<p class="c010">Nil, omnipresent nil, world-soul, spiritual informer of
all matter. Nil in the shape of a black-breeched moon-basined
Toreador. Nil, the man with the greyhound’s
nose. Nil, as four blackamoors. Nil in the form of a
divine tune. Nil, the faces, the faces one ought to know by
sight, reflected in the mirrors of the hall. Nil this Gumbril
whose arm is round one’s waist, whose feet step in and out
among one’s own. Nothing at all.</p>
<p class="c010">That’s why there’ll be no wedding. No wedding at St.
George’s, Hanover Square,—oh, desperate experiment!—with
Nil Viveash, that charming boy, that charming nothing
at all, engaged at the moment in hunting elephants, hunting
fever and carnivores among the Tikki-tikki pygmies. That’s
why there’ll be no wedding on Wednesday week. For
Lycidas is dead, dead ere his prime. For the light strawy
hair (not a lock left), the brown face, the red-brown hands
and the smooth boy’s body, milk-white, milk-warm, are
nothing at all, nothing, now, at all—nil these five years—and
the shining blue eyes as much nil as the rest.</p>
<p class="c010">“Always the same people,” complained Mrs. Viveash,
looking round the room. “The old familiar faces. Never
any one new. Where’s the younger generation, Gumbril?
We’re old, Theodore. There are millions younger than we
are. Where are they?”</p>
<p class="c010">“I’m not responsible for them,” said Gumbril. “I’m
not even responsible for myself.” He imagined a cottagey
room, under the roof, with a window near the floor and a
<span class="pageno" id="Page_217">217</span>sloping ceiling where you were always bumping your head;
and in the candlelight Emily’s candid eyes, her grave and
happy mouth; in the darkness, the curve, under his fingers,
of her firm body.</p>
<p class="c010">“Why don’t they come and sing for their supper?”
Mrs. Viveash went on petulantly. “It’s their business to
amuse us.”</p>
<p class="c010">“They’re probably thinking of amusing themselves,”
Gumbril suggested.</p>
<p class="c010">“Well, then, they should do it where we can see them.”</p>
<p class="c010">“What’s he to Hecuba?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Nothing at all,” Gumbril clownishly sang. The room,
in the cottage, had nothing to do with him. He breathed
Mrs. Viveash’s memories of Italian jasmines, laid his cheek
for a moment against her smooth hair. “Nothing at all.”
Happy clown!</p>
<p class="c010">Way down in old Bengal, under the green Paradisiac
palms, among the ecstatic mystagogues and the saints who
scream beneath the divine caresses, the music came to an
end. The four negroes wiped their glistening faces. The
couples fell apart. Gumbril and Mrs. Viveash sat down and
smoked a cigarette.</p>

<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c009">The blackamoors had left the platform at the end
of the hall. The curtains looped up at either side
had slid down, cutting it off from the rest of the
room—“making two worlds,” Gumbril elegantly and
allusively put it, “where only one grew before—and one
of them a better world,” he added too philosophically,
“because unreal.” There was the theatrical silence, the
suspense. The curtains parted again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="c010">On a narrow bed—on a bier perhaps—the corpse of a
woman. The husband kneels beside it. At the foot stands
the doctor, putting away his instruments. In a beribboned
pink cradle reposes a monstrous baby.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Husband</span>: Margaret! Margaret!</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Doctor</span>: She is dead.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Husband</span>: Margaret!</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Doctor</span>: Of septicæmia, I tell you.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Husband</span>: I wish that I too were dead!</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Doctor</span>: But you won’t to-morrow.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Husband</span>: To-morrow! But I don’t want to live

<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Doctor</span>: You will to-morrow.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Husband</span>: Margaret! Margaret! Wait for me
there; I shall not fail to meet you in that hollow vale.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Doctor</span>: You will not be slow to survive her.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Husband</span>: Christ have mercy upon us!</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_219">219</span><span class="sc">The Doctor</span>: You would do better to think of the child.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Husband</span> (<em>rising and standing menacingly over the

<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Doctor</span>: No worse than others.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Husband</span>: Begotten in a night of immaculate
pleasure, monster, may you live loveless, in dirt and impurity!</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Doctor</span>: Conceived in lust and darkness, may your
own impurity always seem heavenly, monster, in your own
eyes!</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Husband</span>: Murderer, slowly die all your life long!</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Doctor</span>: The child must be fed.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Husband</span>: Fed? With what?</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Doctor</span>: With milk.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Husband</span>: Her milk is cold in her breasts.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Doctor</span>: There are still cows.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Husband</span>: Tubercular shorthorns. (<em>Calling.</em>) Let

<p class="c010"><span class="sc">Voices</span> (<em>off</em>): Short-i’-the-horn! Short-i’-the-horn!

<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Doctor</span>: In nineteen hundred and twenty-one,

died in childbirth.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Husband</span>: But none of them belonged to my

<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Doctor</span>: Each of them was somebody’s wife.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Husband</span>: Doubtless. But the people we don’t

the tragedians.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Doctor</span>: Not in the spectator’s eyes.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Husband</span>: Do I think of the spectators? Ah,

<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_220">220</span><span class="sc">The Doctor</span>: The twenty-seven thousand nine hundred

<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Husband</span>: Ah, good Short-i’-the-horn! (<em>He pats

<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Yokel</span>: Ay, sir.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Husband</span>: And found tubercular. No?</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Yokel</span>: Even in the udders, may it please you.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Husband</span>: Excellent! Milk me the cow, sir, into

<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Yokel</span>: I will, sir. (<em>He milks the cow.</em>)</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Husband</span>: Her milk—her milk is cold already. All
the woman in her chilled and curdled within her breasts.
Ah, Jesus! what miraculous galactagogue will make it flow
again?</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Yokel</span>: The wash-pot is full, sir.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Husband</span>: Then take the cow away.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Yokel</span>: Come, Short-i’-the-horn; come up, good

Here’s for you, monster, to drink your own health
in. (<em>He gives the bottle to the child.</em>)</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">Curtain.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="c010">“A little ponderous, perhaps,” said Gumbril, as the
curtain came down.</p>
<p class="c010">“But I liked the cow.” Mrs. Viveash opened her
cigarette-case and found it empty. Gumbril offered her
one of his. She shook her head. “I don’t want it in the
least,” she said.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_221">221</span>“Yes, the cow was in the best pantomime tradition,”
Gumbril agreed. Ah! but it was a long time since he had
been to a Christmas pantomime. Not since Dan Leno’s
days. All the little cousins, the uncles and aunts on both
sides of the family, dozens and dozens of them—every year
they filled the best part of a row in the dress circle at Drury
Lane. And buns were stickily passed from hand to hand,
chocolates circulated; the grown-ups drank tea. And the
pantomime went on and on, glory after glory, under the
shining arch of the stage. Hours and hours; and the
grown-ups always wanted to go away before the harlequinade.
And the children felt sick from eating too much chocolate,
or wanted with such extreme urgency to go to the w.c.
that they had to be led out, trampling and stumbling over
everybody else’s feet—and every stumble making the need
more agonizingly great—in the middle of the transformation
scene. And there was Dan Leno, inimitable Dan
Leno, dead now as poor Yorick, no more than a mere skull
like anybody else’s skull. And his mother, he remembered,
used to laugh at him sometimes till the tears ran down her
cheeks. She used to enjoy things thoroughly, with a whole
heart.</p>
<p class="c010">“I wish they’d hurry up with the second scene,” said
Mrs. Viveash. “If there’s anything that bores me, it’s
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entr’actes</span></i>.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Most of one’s life is an <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entr’acte</span></i>,” said Gumbril, whose
present mood of hilarious depression seemed favourable to
the enunciation of apophthegms.</p>
<p class="c010">“None of your cracker mottoes, please,” protested Mrs.
Viveash. All the same, she reflected, what was she doing
now but waiting for the curtain to go up again, waiting,
with what unspeakable weariness of spirit, for the curtain
<span class="pageno" id="Page_222">222</span>that had rung down, ten centuries ago, on those blue eyes,
that bright strawy hair and the weathered face?</p>
<p class="c010">“Thank God,” she said with an expiring earnestness,
“here’s the second scene!”</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="c010">The curtain went up. In a bald room stood the Monster,
grown now from an infant into a frail and bent young man
with bandy legs. At the back of the stage a large window
giving on to a street along which people pass.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Monster</span> (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">solus</span></i>): The young girls of Sparta, they
say, used to wrestle naked with naked Spartan boys. The
sun caressed their skins till they were brown and transparent
like amber or a flask of olive oil. Their breasts were hard,
their bellies flat. They were pure with the chastity of
beautiful animals. Their thoughts were clear, their minds
cool and untroubled. I spit blood into my handkerchief
and sometimes I feel in my mouth something slimy, soft
and disgusting, like a slug—and I have coughed up a shred
of my lung. The rickets from which I suffered in childhood
have bent my bones and made them old and brittle. All
my life I have lived in this huge town, whose domes and
spires are wrapped in a cloud of stink that hides the sun.
The slug-dank tatters of lung that I spit out are black with
the soot I have been breathing all these years. I am now
come of age. Long-expected one-and-twenty has made me
a fully privileged citizen of this great realm of which the
owners of the <cite>Daily Mirror</cite>, the <cite>News of the World</cite> and the
<cite>Daily Express</cite> are noble peers. Somewhere, I must logically
infer, there must be other cities, built by men for men to
live in. Somewhere, in the past, in the future, a very long
way off.... But perhaps the only street improvement
schemes that ever really improve the streets are schemes
<span class="pageno" id="Page_223">223</span>in the minds of those who live in them: schemes of love
mostly. Ah! here she comes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="c010">(<em>The</em> <span class="sc">Young Lady</span> <em>enters. She stands outside
the window, in the street, paying no attention
to the</em> <span class="sc">Monster</span>; <em>she seems to be waiting for
somebody.</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="c010">She is like a pear tree in flower. When she smiles, it is as
though there were stars. Her hair is like the harvest in an
eclogue, her cheeks are all the fruits of summer. Her arms
and thighs are as beautiful as the soul of St. Catherine of
Siena. And her eyes, her eyes are plumbless with thought
and limpidly pure like the water of the mountains.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Young Lady</span>: If I wait till the summer sale, the
crêpe de Chine will be reduced by at least two shillings a
yard, and on six camisoles that will mean a lot of money.
But the question is: can I go from May till the end of
July with the underclothing I have now?</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Monster</span>: If I knew her, I should know the universe!</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Young Lady</span>: My present ones are so dreadfully
middle-class. And if Roger should ... by any chance....</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Monster</span>: Or, rather, I should be able to ignore it,
having a private universe of my own.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Young Lady</span>: If—if he did—well, it might be
rather humiliating with these I have ... like a servant’s
almost....</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Monster</span>: Love makes you accept the world; it
puts an end to criticism.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Young Lady</span>: His hand already....</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Monster</span>: Dare I, dare I tell her how beautiful she
is?</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Young Lady</span>: On the whole, I think I’d better get
it now, though it will cost more.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_224">224</span><span class="sc">The Monster</span> (<em>desperately advancing to the window as
though to assault a battery</em>): Beautiful! beautiful!</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Young Lady</span> (<em>looking at him</em>): Ha, ha, ha!</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Monster</span>: But I love you, flowering pear tree; I
love you, golden harvest; I love you, fruitage of summer; I
love you, body and limbs, with the shape of a saint’s thought.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Young Lady</span> (<em>redoubles her laughter</em>): Ha, ha, ha!</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Monster</span> (<em>taking her hand</em>): You cannot be cruel!
(<em>He is seized with a violent paroxysm of coughing which doubles
him up, which shakes and torments him. The handkerchief he
holds to his mouth is spotted with blood.</em>)</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Young Lady</span>: You disgust me! (<em>She draws away
her skirts so that they shall not come in contact with him.</em>)</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Monster</span>: But I swear to you, I love—I—— (<em>He
is once more interrupted by his cough.</em>)</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Young Lady</span>: Please go away. (<em>In a different voice</em>)
Ah, Roger! (<em>She advances to meet a snub-nosed lubber with
curly hair and a face like a groom’s, who passes along the street
at this moment.</em>)</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">Roger</span>: I’ve got the motor-bike waiting at the corner.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Young Lady</span>: Let’s go, then.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">Roger</span> (<em>pointing to the</em> <span class="sc">Monster</span>): What’s that?</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Young Lady</span>: Oh, it’s nothing in particular.</p>
<p class="c014">(<em>Both roar with laughter.</em> <span class="sc">Roger</span> <em>escorts her
out, patting her familiarly on the back as
they walk along.</em>)</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Monster</span> (<em>looking after her</em>): There is a wound
under my left pap. She has deflowered all women. I
cannot....</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="c010">“Lord!” whispered Mrs. Viveash, “how this young
man bores me!”</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_225">225</span>“I confess,” replied Gumbril, “I have rather a taste
for moralities. There is a pleasant uplifting vagueness
about these symbolical generalized figures which pleases
me.”</p>
<p class="c010">“You were always charmingly simple-minded,” said Mrs.
Viveash. “But who’s this? As long as the young man
isn’t left alone on the stage, I don’t mind.”</p>
<p class="c014">Another female figure has appeared in the street beyond
the window. It is the Prostitute. Her face, painted in
two tones of red, white, green, blue and black, is the most
tasteful of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nature-mortes</span></i>.</p>
<p class="c014"><span class="sc">The Prostitute</span>: Hullo, duckie!</p>
<p class="c014"><span class="sc">The Monster</span>: Hullo!</p>
<p class="c014"><span class="sc">The Prostitute</span>: Are you lonely?</p>
<p class="c014"><span class="sc">The Monster</span>: Yes.</p>
<p class="c014"><span class="sc">The Prostitute</span>: Would you like me to come in to see
you?</p>
<p class="c014"><span class="sc">The Monster</span>: Very well.</p>
<p class="c014"><span class="sc">The Prostitute</span>: Shall we say thirty bob?</p>
<p class="c014"><span class="sc">The Monster</span>: As you like.</p>
<p class="c014"><span class="sc">The Prostitute</span>: Come along then.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="c014">(<em>She climbs through the window and they go off
together through the door on the left of the
stage. The curtains descend for a moment,
then rise again. The</em> <span class="sc">Monster</span> <em>and the</em>
<span class="sc">Prostitute</span> <em>are seen issuing from the door at
which they went out.</em>)</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Monster</span> (<em>taking out a cheque-book and a fountain pen</em>):
Thirty shillings....</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Prostitute</span>: Thank you. Not a cheque. I don’t
want any cheques. How do I know it isn’t a dud one that
<span class="pageno" id="Page_226">226</span>they’ll refuse payment for at the bank? Ready money for
me, thanks.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Monster</span>: But I haven’t got any cash on me at the
moment.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Prostitute</span>: Well, I won’t take a cheque. Once
bitten, twice shy, I can tell you.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Monster</span>: But I tell you I haven’t got any cash.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Prostitute</span>: Well, all I can say is, here I stay till I
get it. And, what’s more, if I don’t get it quick, I’ll make
a row.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Monster</span>: But this is absurd. I offer you a perfectly
good cheque....</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Prostitute</span>: And I won’t take it. So there!</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Monster</span>: Well then, take my watch. It’s worth
more than thirty bob. (<em>He pulls out his gold half-hunter.</em>)</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Prostitute</span>: Thank you, and get myself arrested
as soon as I take it to the pop-shop! No, I want cash, I
tell you.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Monster</span>: But where the devil do you expect me
to get it at this time of night?</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Prostitute</span>: I don’t know. But you’ve got to get
it pretty quick.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Monster</span>: You’re unreasonable.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Prostitute</span>: Aren’t there any servants in this
house?</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Monster</span>: Yes.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Prostitute</span>: Well, go and borrow it from one of
them.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Monster</span>: But really, that would be too low, too
humiliating.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Prostitute</span>: All right, I’ll begin kicking up a noise.
I’ll go to the window and yell till all the neighbours are
<span class="pageno" id="Page_227">227</span>woken up and the police come to see what’s up. You can
borrow it from the copper then.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Monster</span>: You really won’t take my cheque? I
swear to you it’s perfectly all right. There’s plenty of
money to meet it.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Prostitute</span>: Oh, shut up! No more dilly-dallying.
Get me my money at once, or I’ll start the row. One,
two, three.... (<em>She opens her mouth wide as if to yell.</em>)</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Monster</span>: All right. (<em>He goes out.</em>)</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Prostitute</span>: Nice state of things we’re coming to,
when young rips try and swindle us poor girls out of our
money! Mean, stinking skunks! I’d like to slit the
throats of some of them.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Monster</span> (<em>coming back again</em>): Here you are. (<em>He
hands her money.</em>)</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Prostitute</span> (<em>examining it</em>): Thank you, dearie.
Any other time you’re lonely....</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Monster</span>: No, no!</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Prostitute</span>: Where did you get it finally?</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Monster</span>: I woke the cook.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Prostitute</span> (<em>goes off into a peal of laughter</em>): Well,
so long, duckie. (<em>She goes out.</em>)</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Monster</span> (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">solus</span></i>): Somewhere there must be love
like music. Love harmonious and ordered: two spirits,
two bodies moving contrapuntally together. Somewhere,
the stupid brutish act must be made to make sense, must be
enriched, must be made significant. Lust, like Diabelli’s
waltz, a stupid air, turned by a genius into three-and-thirty
fabulous variations. Somewhere....</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="c010">“Oh dear!” sighed Mrs. Viveash.</p>
<p class="c010">“Charming!” Gumbril protested.</p>
<div><span class="pageno" id="Page_228">228</span></div>
<blockquote>
<p class="c010">... love like sheets of silky flame; like landscapes
brilliant in the sunlight against a background of purple
thunder; like the solution of a cosmic problem; like
faith....</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="c010">“Crikey!” said Mrs. Viveash.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="c010">... Somewhere, somewhere. But in my veins creep the
maggots of the pox....</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="c010">“Really, really!” Mrs. Viveash shook her head. “Too
medical!”</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="c010">... crawling towards the brain, crawling into the
mouth, burrowing into the bones. Insatiably.</p>
<p class="c010">The Monster threw himself to the ground, and the
curtain came down.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="c010">“And about time too!” declared Mrs. Viveash.</p>
<p class="c010">“Charming!” Gumbril stuck to his guns. “Charming!
charming!”</p>
<p class="c010">There was a disturbance near the door. Mrs. Viveash
looked round to see what was happening. “And now on
top of it all,” she said, “here comes Coleman, raving, with
an unknown drunk.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Have we missed it?” Coleman was shouting. “Have
we missed all the lovely bloody farce?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Lovely bloody!” his companion repeated with drunken
raptures, and he went into fits of uncontrollable laughter.
He was a very young boy with straight dark hair and a face
of Hellenic beauty, now distorted with tipsiness.</p>
<p class="c010">Coleman greeted his acquaintances in the hall, shouting
a jovial obscenity to each. “And Bumbril-Gumbril,” he
exclaimed, catching sight of him at last in the front row.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_229">229</span>“And Hetaira-Myra!” He pushed his way through the
crowd, followed unsteadily by his young disciple. “So
you’re here,” he said, standing over them and looking down
with an enigmatic malice in his bright blue eyes. “Where’s
the physiologue?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Am I the physiologue’s keeper?” asked Gumbril.
“He’s with his glands and his hormones, I suppose. Not
to mention his wife.” He smiled to himself.</p>
<p class="c010">“Where the hormones, there moan I,” said Coleman,
skidding off sideways along the slippery word. “I hear,
by the way, that there’s a lovely prostitute in this play.”</p>
<p class="c010">“You’ve missed her,” said Mrs. Viveash.</p>
<p class="c010">“What a misfortune,” said Coleman. “We’ve missed
the delicious trull,” he said, turning to the young
man.</p>
<p class="c010">The young man only laughed.</p>
<p class="c010">“Let me introduce, by the way,” said Coleman. “This
is Dante,” he pointed to the dark-haired boy; “and I am
Virgil. We’re making a round tour—or, rather, a descending
spiral tour of hell. But we’re only at the first circle so
far. These, Alighieri, are two damned souls, though not, as
you might suppose, Paolo and Francesca.”</p>
<p class="c010">The boy continued to laugh, happily and uncomprehendingly.</p>
<p class="c010">“Another of these interminable <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entr’actes</span></i>,” complained
Mrs. Viveash. “I was just saying to Theodore here that if
there’s one thing I dislike more than another, it’s a long
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entr’acte</span></i>.” Would hers ever come to an end?</p>
<p class="c010">“And if there’s one thing <em>I</em> dislike more than another,”
said the boy, breaking silence for the first time, with an
air of the greatest earnestness, “it’s ... it’s one thing
more than another.”</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_230">230</span>“And you’re perfectly right in doing so,” said Coleman.
“Perfectly right.”</p>
<p class="c010">“I know,” the boy replied modestly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="c010">When the curtain rose again it was on an aged Monster,
with a black patch over the left side of his nose, no hair,
no teeth, and sitting harmlessly behind the bars of an asylum.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Monster</span>: Asses, apes and dogs! Milton called
them that; he should have known. Somewhere there must
be men, however. The variations on Diabelli prove it.
Brunelleschi’s dome is more than the magnification of Cléo
de Mérode’s breast. Somewhere there are men with power,
living reasonably. Like our mythical Greeks and Romans.
Living cleanly. The images of the gods are their portraits.
They walk under their own protection. (<em>The</em> <span class="sc">Monster</span>
<em>climbs on to a chair and stands in the posture of a statue</em>.)
Jupiter, father of gods, a man, I bless myself, I throw bolts
at my own disobedience, I answer my own prayers, I
pronounce oracles to satisfy the questions I myself propound.
I abolish all tetters, poxes, blood-spitting, rotting of bones.
With love I recreate the world from within. Europa puts
an end to squalor, Leda does away with tyranny, Danae
tempers stupidity. After establishing these reforms in the
social sewer, I climb, I climb, up through the manhole,
out of the manhole, beyond humanity. For the manhole,
even the manhole, is dark; though not so dingy as the doghole
it was before I altered it. Up through the manhole,
towards the air. Up, up! (<em>And the</em> <span class="sc">Monster</span>, <em>suiting the
action to his words, climbs up the runged back of his chair
and stands, by a miraculous feat of acrobacy, on the topmost
bar</em>.) I begin to see the stars through other eyes than my
own. More than dog already, I become more than man.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_231">231</span>I begin to have inklings of the shape and sense of things.
Upwards, upwards I strain, I peer, I reach aloft. (<em>The
balanced</em> <span class="sc">Monster</span> <em>reaches, strains and peers</em>.) And I seize,
I seize! (<em>As he shouts these words, the</em> <span class="sc">Monster</span> <em>falls heavily,
head foremost, to the floor. He lies there quite still. After a
little time the door opens and the</em> <span class="sc">Doctor</span> <em>of the first scene
enters with a</em> <span class="sc">Warder</span>.)</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Warder</span>: I heard a crash.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Doctor</span> (<em>who has by this time become immensely old
and has a beard like Father Thames</em>): It looks as though you
were right. (<em>He examines the</em> <span class="sc">Monster</span>.)</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Warder</span>: He was for ever climbing on to his chair.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Doctor</span>: Well, he won’t any more. His neck’s
broken.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Warder</span>: You don’t say so?</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Doctor</span>: I do.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Warder</span>: Well, I never!</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Doctor</span>: Have it carried down to the dissecting-room.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="sc">The Warder</span>: I’ll send for the porters at once.</p>
<p class="c010">(<em>Exeunt severally, and</em> <span class="sc">Curtain</span>.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="c010">“Well,” said Mrs. Viveash, “I’m glad that’s over.”</p>
<p class="c010">The music struck up again, saxophone and ’cello, with the
thin draught of the violin to cool their ecstasies and the
thumping piano to remind them of business. Gumbril and
Mrs. Viveash slid out into the dancing crowd, revolving as
though by force of habit.</p>
<p class="c010">“These substitutes for the genuine copulative article,”
said Coleman to his disciple, “are beneath the dignity of
hell-hounds like you and me.”</p>
<p class="c010">Charmed, the young man laughed; he was attentive as
<span class="pageno" id="Page_232">232</span>though at the feet of Socrates. Coleman had found him in
a night club, where he had gone in search of Zoe, found him
very drunk in the company of two formidable women fifteen
or twenty years his senior, who were looking after him, half
maternally out of pure kindness of heart, half professionally;
for he seemed to be carrying a good deal of money. He was
incapable of looking after himself. Coleman had pounced
on him at once, claimed an old friendship which the youth
was too tipsy to be able to deny, and carried him off. There
was something, he always thought, peculiarly interesting
about the spectacle of children tobogganing down into the
cesspools.</p>
<p class="c010">“I like this place,” said the young man.</p>
<p class="c010">“Tastes differ!” Coleman shrugged his shoulders.
“The German professors have catalogued thousands of
people whose whole pleasure consists in eating dung.”</p>
<p class="c010">The young man smiled and nodded, rather vaguely. “Is
there anything to drink here?” he asked.</p>
<p class="c010">“Too respectable,” Coleman answered, shaking his
head.</p>
<p class="c010">“I think this is a bloody place,” said the young man.</p>
<p class="c010">“Ah! but some people like blood. And some like boots.
And some like long gloves and corsets. And some like birch-rods.
And some like sliding down slopes and can’t look at
Michelangelo’s ‘Night’ on the Medici Tombs without
dying the little death, because the statue seems to be sliding.
And some....”</p>
<p class="c010">“But I want something to drink,” insisted the young
man.</p>
<p class="c010">Coleman stamped his feet, waved his arms. “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">À boire!
à boire!</span></i>” he shouted, like the newborn Gargantua. Nobody
paid any attention.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_233">233</span>The music came to an end. Gumbril and Mrs. Viveash
reappeared.</p>
<p class="c010">“Dante,” said Coleman, “calls for drink. We must
leave the building.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Yes. Anything to get out of this,” said Mrs. Viveash.
“What’s the time?”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril looked at his watch. “Half-past one.”</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Viveash sighed. “Can’t possibly go to bed,” she
said, “for another hour at least.”</p>
<p class="c010">They walked out into the street. The stars were large
and brilliant overhead. There was a little wind that almost
seemed to come from the country. Gumbril thought so,
at any rate; he thought of the country.</p>
<p class="c010">“The question is, where?” said Coleman. “You can
come to my bordello, if you like; but it’s a long way off
and Zoe hates us all so much, she’ll probably set on us with
the meat-chopper. If she’s back again, that is. Though
she may be out all night. <i><span lang="el-ltn" xml:lang="el-ltn">Zoe mou, sas agapo.</span></i> Shall we
risk it?”</p>
<p class="c010">“To me it’s quite indifferent,” said Mrs. Viveash faintly,
as though wholly preoccupied with expiring.</p>
<p class="c010">“Or there’s my place,” Gumbril said abruptly, as though
shaking himself awake out of some dream.</p>
<p class="c010">“But you live still farther, don’t you?” said Coleman.
“With venerable parents, and so forth. One foot in the
grave and all that. Shall we mingle hornpipes with
funerals?” He began to hum Chopin’s ‘Funeral March’
at three times its proper speed, and seizing the young
stranger in his arms, two-stepped two or three turns on the
pavement, then released his hold and let him go reeling
against the area railings.</p>
<p class="c010">“No, I don’t mean the family mansion,” said Gumbril.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_234">234</span>“I mean my own rooms. They’re quite near. In Great
Russell Street.”</p>
<p class="c010">“I never knew you had any rooms, Theodore,” said Mrs.
Viveash.</p>
<p class="c010">“Nobody did.” Why should they know now? Because
the wind seemed almost a country wind? “There’s drink
there,” he said.</p>
<p class="c010">“Splendid!” cried the young man. They were all
splendid people.</p>
<p class="c010">“There’s some gin,” said Gumbril.</p>
<p class="c010">“Capital aphrodisiac!” Coleman commented.</p>
<p class="c010">“Some light white wine.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Diuretic.”</p>
<p class="c010">“And some whisky.”</p>
<p class="c010">“The great emetic,” said Coleman. “Come on.” And
he struck up the March of the Fascisti. “<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giovinezza,
giovinezza, primavera di bellezza</span></i>....” The noise went
fading down the dark, empty streets.</p>
<p class="c010">The gin, the white wine, and even, for the sake of the
young stranger, who wanted to sample everything, the
emetic whisky, were produced.</p>
<p class="c010">“I like your rooms,” said Mrs. Viveash, looking
round her. “And I resent your secrecy about them,
Theodore.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Drink, puppy!” Coleman refilled the boy’s glass.</p>
<p class="c010">“Here’s to secrecy,” Gumbril proposed. Shut it
tightly, keep it dark, cover it up. Be silent, prevaricate,
lie outright. He laughed and drank. “Do you remember,”
he went on, “those instructive advertisements of
Eno’s Fruit Salt they used to have when we were young?
There was one little anecdote about a doctor who advised
the hypochondriacal patient who had come to consult him,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_235">235</span>to go and see Grimaldi, the clown; and the patient answered,
‘I am Grimaldi.’ Do you remember?”</p>
<p class="c010">“No,” said Mrs. Viveash. “And why do you?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Oh, I don’t know. Or rather, I do know,” Gumbril
corrected himself, and laughed again.</p>
<p class="c010">The young man suddenly began to boast. “I lost two
hundred pounds yesterday playing <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chemin de fer</span></i>,” he said,
and looked round for applause.</p>
<p class="c010">Coleman patted his curly head. “Delicious child!” he
said. “You’re positively Hogarthian.”</p>
<p class="c010">Angrily, the boy pushed him away. “What are you
doing?” he shouted; then turned and addressed himself
once more to the others. “I couldn’t afford it, you know—not
a bloody penny of it. Not my money, either.” He
seemed to find it exquisitely humorous. “And that two
hundred wasn’t all,” he added, almost expiring with mirth.</p>
<p class="c010">“Tell Coleman how you borrowed his beard, Theodore.”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril was looking intently into his glass, as though he
hoped to see in its pale mixture of gin and Sauterne visions,
as in a crystal, of the future. Mrs. Viveash touched him
on the arm and repeated her injunction.</p>
<p class="c010">“Oh, that!” said Gumbril rather irritably. “No. It
isn’t an interesting story.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Oh yes, it is! I insist,” said Mrs. Viveash, commanding
peremptorily from her death-bed.</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril drank his gin and Sauterne. “Very well then,”
he said reluctantly, and began.</p>
<p class="c010">“I don’t know what my governor will say,” the young
man put in once or twice. But nobody paid any attention
to him. He relapsed into a sulky and, it seemed to him,
very dignified silence. Under the warm, jolly tipsiness he
felt a chill of foreboding. He poured out some more whisky.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_236">236</span>Gumbril warmed to his anecdote. Expiringly Mrs.
Viveash laughed from time to time, or smiled her agonizing
smile. Coleman whooped like a Redskin.</p>
<p class="c010">“And after the concert to these rooms,” said Gumbril.</p>
<p class="c010">Well, let everything go. Into the mud. Leave it there,
and let the dogs lift their hind legs over it as they pass.</p>
<p class="c010">“Ah! the genuine platonic fumblers,” commented
Coleman.</p>
<p class="c010">“I am Grimaldi,” Gumbril laughed. Further than this
it was difficult to see where the joke could go. There, on
the couch, where Mrs. Viveash and Coleman were now
sitting, she had lain sleeping in his arms.</p>
<p class="c010">“Towsing, in Elizabethan,” said Coleman.</p>
<p class="c010">Unreal, eternal in the secret darkness. A night that was
an eternal parenthesis among the other nights and days.</p>
<p class="c010">“I feel I’m going to be sick,” said the young man suddenly.
He had wanted to go on silently and haughtily
sulking; but his stomach declined to take part in the
dignified game.</p>
<p class="c010">“Good Lord!” said Gumbril, and jumped up. But
before he could do anything effective, the young man had
fulfilled his own prophecy.</p>
<p class="c010">“The real charm about debauchery,” said Coleman
philosophically, “is its total pointlessness, futility, and
above all its incredible tediousness. If it really were all
roses and exhilaration, as these poor children seem to
imagine, it would be no better than going to church or
studying the higher mathematics. I should never touch a
drop of wine or another harlot again. It would be against
my principles. I told you it was emetic,” he called to the
young man.</p>
<p class="c010">“And what are your principles?” asked Mrs. Viveash.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_237">237</span>“Oh, strictly ethical,” said Coleman.</p>
<p class="c010">“You’re responsible for this creature,” said Gumbril,
pointing to the young man, who was sitting on the floor
near the fireplace, cooling his forehead against the marble
of the mantelpiece. “You must take him away. Really,
what a bore!” His nose and mouth were all wrinkled up
with disgust.</p>
<p class="c010">“I’m sorry,” the young man whispered. He kept his eyes
shut and his face was exceedingly pale.</p>
<p class="c010">“But with pleasure,” said Coleman. “What’s your
name?” he asked the young man, “and where do you
live?”</p>
<p class="c010">“My name is Porteous,” murmured the young man.</p>
<p class="c010">“Good lord!” cried Gumbril, letting himself fall on to
the couch beside Mrs. Viveash. “That’s the last straw!”</p>

<h2 class="c008">CHAPTER XVII</h2>
</div>
<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c009">The two o’clock snorted out of Charing Cross, but no
healths were drunk, this time, to Viscount Lascelles.
A desiccating sobriety made arid the corner of the
third-class carriage in which Gumbril was sitting. His
thoughts were an interminable desert of sand, with not a
palm in sight, not so much as a comforting mirage. Once
again he fumbled in his breast-pocket, brought out and
unfolded the flimsy paper. Once more he read. How many
times had he read before?</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="c010">“Your telegram made me very unhappy. Not merely
because of the accident—though it made me shudder to
think that something terrible might have happened, poor
darling—but also, selfishly, my own disappointment. I
had looked forward so much. I had made a picture of it all
so clearly. I should have met you at the station with the
horse and trap from the Chequers, and we’d have driven
back to the cottage—and you’d have loved the cottage.
We’d have had tea and I’d have made you eat an egg with
it after your journey. Then we’d have gone for a walk;
through the most heavenly wood I found yesterday to a
place where there’s a wonderful view—miles and miles of
it. And we’d have wandered on and on, and sat down under
the trees, and the sun would have set, and the twilight
would slowly have come to an end, and we’d have gone
home again and found the lamps lighted and supper ready—not
<span class="pageno" id="Page_239">239</span>very grand, I’m afraid, for Mrs. Vole isn’t the best of
cooks. And then the piano; for there is a piano, and I
had the tuner come specially from Hastings yesterday, so
that it isn’t <em>so</em> bad now. And you’d have played; and
perhaps I would have made my noises on it. And at last
it would have been time for candles and bed. When I
heard you were coming, Theodore, I told Mrs. Vole a lie
about you. I said you were my husband, because she’s
fearfully respectable, of course; and it would dreadfully
disturb her if you weren’t. But I told myself that, too.
I meant that you should be. You see, I tell you everything.
I’m not ashamed. I wanted to give you everything I could,
and then we should always be together, loving one another.
And I should have been your slave, I should have been
your property and lived inside your life. But you would
always have had to love me.</p>
<p class="c010">“And then, just as I was getting ready to go and call
at the Chequers for the horse and trap, your telegram came.
I saw the word ‘accident,’ and I imagined you all bleeding
and smashed—oh, dreadful, dreadful. But then, when you
seemed to make rather a joke of it—why did you say ‘a
little indisposed?’ that seemed, somehow, so stupid, I
thought—and said you were coming to-morrow, it wasn’t
that which upset me; it was the dreadful, dreadful disappointment.
It was like a stab, that disappointment;
it hurt so terribly, so unreasonably much. It made me cry
and cry, so that I thought I should never be able to stop.
And then, gradually, I began to see that the pain of the
disappointment wasn’t unreasonably great. It wasn’t
merely a question of your coming being put off for a day;
it was a question of its being put off for ever, of my never
seeing you again. I saw that that accident had been something
<span class="pageno" id="Page_240">240</span>really arranged by Providence. It was meant to warn
me and show me what I ought to do. I saw how hopelessly
impracticable the happiness I had been imagining really
was. I saw that you didn’t, you couldn’t love me in anything
like the same way as I loved you. I was only a curious
adventure, a new experience, a means to some other end.
Mind, I’m not blaming you in the least. I’m only telling
you what is true, what I gradually came to realize as true.
If you’d come—what then? I’d have given you everything,
my body, my mind, my soul, my whole life. I’d have
twisted myself into the threads of your life. And then,
when in due course you wanted to make an end to this
curious little adventure, you would have had to cut the
tangle and it would have killed me; it would also have
hurt you. At least I think it would. In the end, I thanked
God for the accident which had prevented you coming.
In this way, Providence lets us off very lightly—you with
a bruise or two (for I do hope it really is nothing, my precious
darling), and me with a bruise inside, round the heart. But
both will get well quite soon. And all our lives, we shall
have an afternoon under the trees, an evening of music and
in the darkness, a night, an eternity of happiness, to look
back on. I shall go away from Robertsbridge at once.
Good-bye, Theodore. What a long letter! The last you’ll
ever get from me. The last—what a dreadful hurting word
that is. I shall take it to post at once, for fear, if I leave it, I
may be weak enough to change my mind and let you come to-morrow.
I shall take it at once, then I shall come home again
and pack up and tell some new fib to Mrs. Vole. And after
that, perhaps I shall allow myself to cry again. Good-bye.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="c010">Aridly, the desert of sand stretched out with not a tree
<span class="pageno" id="Page_241">241</span>and not even a mirage, except perhaps the vague and
desperate hope that he might get there before she started,
that she might conceivably have changed her mind. Ah,
if only he’d read the letter a little earlier! But he hadn’t
woken up before eleven, he hadn’t been down before half-past.
Sitting at the breakfast-table, he had read the letter
through.</p>
<p class="c010">The eggs and bacon had grown still colder, if that was
possible, than they were. He had read it through, he had
rushed to the A.B.C. There was no practicable train before
the two o’clock.</p>
<p class="c010">If he had taken the seven-twenty-seven he would certainly
have got there before she started. Ah, if only he
had woken up a little earlier! But then he would have
had to go to bed a little earlier. And in order to go to
bed earlier, he would have had to abandon Mrs. Viveash
before she had bored herself to that ultimate point of
fatigue at which she did at last feel ready for repose. And
to abandon Mrs. Viveash—ah, that was really impossible,
she wouldn’t allow herself to be left alone. If only he
hadn’t gone to the London Library yesterday! A wanton,
unnecessary visit it had been. For after all, the journey
was short; he didn’t need a book for the train. And the <cite>Life
of Beckford</cite>, for which he had asked, proved, of course, to
be out—and he had been utterly incapable of thinking
of any other book, among the two or three hundred thousand
on the shelves, that he wanted to read. And, in any
case, what the devil did he want with a <cite>Life of Beckford</cite>?
Hadn’t he his own life, the life of Gumbril, to attend to?
Wasn’t one life enough, without making superfluous visits
to the London Library in search of other lives? And
then what a stroke of bad luck to have run into Mrs.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_242">242</span>Viveash at that very moment! What an abject weakness
to have let himself be bullied into sending that telegram.
“A little indisposed....” Oh, my God! Gumbril
shut his eyes and ground his teeth together; he felt himself
blushing with a retrospective shame.</p>
<p class="c010">And of course it was quite useless taking the train, like
this, to Robertsbridge. She’d be gone, of course. Still,
there was always the desperate hope. There was the mirage
across the desiccated plains, the mirage one knew to be
deceptive and which, on a second glance, proved not even
to be a mirage, but merely a few livery spots behind the
eyes. Still, it was amply worth doing—as a penance, and to
satisfy the conscience and to deceive oneself with an illusion
of action. And then the fact that he was to have spent
the afternoon with Rosie and had put her off—that too was
highly satisfying. And not merely put her off, but—ultimate
clownery in the worst of deliriously bad taste—played
a joke on her. “Impossible come to you, meet me
213 Sloane Street, second floor, a little indisposed.” He
wondered how she’d get on with Mr. Mercaptan; for it
was to his rococo boudoir and Crébillon-souled sofa that
he had on the spur of the clownish moment, as he
dashed into the post office on the way to the station, sent
her.</p>
<p class="c010">Aridly, the desiccated waste extended. Had she been
right in her letter? Would it really have lasted no more
than a little while, and ended as she prophesied, with an
agonizing cutting of the tangle? Or could it be that she
had held out the one hope of happiness? Wasn’t she
perhaps the one unique being with whom he might have
learned to await in quietness the final coming of that lovely
terrible thing, from before the sound of whose secret footsteps
<span class="pageno" id="Page_243">243</span>more than once and oh! ignobly he had fled? He
could not decide, it was impossible to decide until he had
seen her again, till he had possessed her, mingled his life
with hers. And now she had eluded him; for he knew very
well that he would not find her. He sighed and looked out
of the window.</p>
<p class="c010">The train pulled up at a small suburban station. Suburban,
for though London was already some way behind, the
little sham half-timbered houses near the station, the newer
tile and rough-cast dwellings farther out on the slope of the
hill proclaimed with emphasis the presence of the business
man, the holder of the season ticket. Gumbril looked at
them with a pensive disgust which must have expressed
itself on his features; for the gentleman sitting in the corner
of the carriage facing his, suddenly leaned forward, tapped
him on the knee, and said, “I see you agree with me, sir,
that there are too many people in the world.”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril, who up till now had merely been aware that
somebody was sitting opposite him, now looked with more
attention at the stranger. He was a large, square old
gentleman of robust and flourishing appearance, with a face
of wrinkled brown parchment and a white moustache that
merged, in a handsome curve, with a pair of side whiskers,
in a manner which reminded one of the photographs of the
Emperor Francis Joseph.</p>
<p class="c010">“I perfectly agree with you, sir,” Gumbril answered.
If he had been wearing his beard, he would have gone on to
suggest that loquacious old gentlemen in trains are among
the supernumeraries of the planet. As it was, however
he spoke with courtesy, and smiled in his most engaging
fashion.</p>
<p class="c010">“When I look at all these revolting houses,” the old
<span class="pageno" id="Page_244">244</span>gentleman continued, shaking his fist at the snuggeries of
the season-ticket holders, “I am filled with indignation. I
feel my spleen ready to burst, sir, ready to burst.”</p>
<p class="c010">“I can sympathize with you,” said Gumbril. “The
architecture is certainly not very soothing.”</p>
<p class="c010">“It’s not the architecture I mind so much,” retorted the
old gentleman, “that’s merely a question of art, and all
nonsense so far as I’m concerned. What disgusts me is the
people inside the architecture, the number of them, sir.
And the way they breed. Like maggots, sir, like maggots.
Millions of them, creeping about the face of the country,
spreading blight and dirt wherever they go; ruining everything.
It’s the people I object to.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Ah well,” said Gumbril, “if you will have sanitary
conditions that don’t allow plagues to flourish properly;
if you will tell mothers how to bring up their children, instead
of allowing nature to kill them off in her natural way;
if you will import unlimited supplies of corn and meat:
what can you expect? Of course the numbers go up.”</p>
<p class="c010">The old gentleman waved all this away. “I don’t care
what the causes are,” he said. “That’s all one to me.
What I do object to, sir, is the effects. Why sir, I am old
enough to remember walking through the delicious meadows
beyond Swiss Cottage, I remember seeing the cows milked
in West Hampstead, sir. And now, what do I see now,
when I go there? Hideous red cities pullulating with
Jews, sir. Pullulating with prosperous Jews. Am I right
in being indignant, sir? Do I do well, like the prophet
Jonah, to be angry?”</p>
<p class="c010">“You do, sir,” said Gumbril, with growing enthusiasm,
“and the more so since this frightful increase in population
is the world’s most formidable danger at the present time.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_245">245</span>With populations that in Europe alone expand by millions
every year, no political foresight is possible. A few years
of this mere bestial propagation will suffice to make nonsense
of the wisest schemes of to-day—or would suffice,” he
hastened to correct himself, “if any wise schemes were
being matured at the present.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Very possibly, sir,” said the old gentleman, “but what
I object to is seeing good cornland being turned into streets,
and meadows, where cows used to graze, covered with
houses full of useless and disgusting human beings. I resent
seeing the country parcelled out into back gardens.”</p>
<p class="c010">“And is there any prospect,” Gumbril earnestly asked,
“of our ever being able in the future to support the whole
of our population? Will unemployment ever decrease?”</p>
<p class="c010">“I don’t know, sir,” the old gentleman replied. “But
the families of the unemployed will certainly increase.”</p>
<p class="c010">“You are right, sir,” said Gumbril, “they will. And
the families of the employed and the prosperous will as
steadily grow smaller. It is regrettable that birth control
should have begun at the wrong end of the scale. There
seems to be a level of poverty below which it doesn’t seem
worth while practising birth control, and a level of education
below which birth control is regarded as morally wrong.
Strange, how long it has taken for the ideas of love and
procreation to dissociate themselves in the human mind.
In the majority of minds they are still, even in this so-called
twentieth century, indivisibly wedded. Still,” he continued
hopefully, “progress is being made, progress is
certainly, though slowly, being made. It is gratifying to
find, for example, in the latest statistics, that the clergy, as
a class, are now remarkable for the smallness of their families.
The old jest is out of date. Is it too much to hope that
<span class="pageno" id="Page_246">246</span>these gentlemen may bring themselves in time to preach
what they already practise?”</p>
<p class="c010">“It <em>is</em> too much to hope, sir,” the old gentleman answered
with decision.</p>
<p class="c010">“You are probably right,” said Gumbril.</p>
<p class="c010">“If we were all to preach all the things we all practise,”
continued the old gentleman, “the world would soon be
a pretty sort of bear-garden, I can tell you. Yes, and a
monkey-house. And a wart-hoggery. As it is, sir, it is
merely a place where there are too many human beings.
Vice must pay its tribute to virtue, or else we are all undone.”</p>
<p class="c010">“I admire your wisdom, sir,” said Gumbril.</p>
<p class="c010">The old gentleman was delighted. “And I have been
much impressed by your philosophical reflections,” he said.
“Tell me, are you at all interested in old brandy?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Well, not philosophically,” said Gumbril. “As a mere
empiric only.”</p>
<p class="c010">“As a mere empiric!” The old gentleman laughed.
“Then let me beg you to accept a case. I have a cellar
which I shall never drink dry, alas! before I die. My only
wish is that what remains of it shall be distributed among
those who can really appreciate it. In you, sir, I see a
fitting recipient of a case of brandy.”</p>
<p class="c010">“You overwhelm me,” said Gumbril. “You are too
kind, and, I may add, too flattering.” The train, which
was a mortally slow one, came grinding for what seemed
the hundredth time to a halt.</p>
<p class="c010">“Not at all,” said the old gentleman. “If you have a
card, sir.”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril searched his pockets. “I have come without
one.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Never mind,” said the old gentleman. “I think I
<span class="pageno" id="Page_247">247</span>have a pencil. If you will give me your name and address,
I will have the case sent to you at once.”</p>
<p class="c010">Leisurely, he hunted for the pencil, he took out a notebook.
The train gave a jerk forward.</p>
<p class="c010">“Now, sir,” he said.</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril began dictating. “Theodore,” he said slowly.</p>
<p class="c010">“The—o—dore,” the old gentleman repeated, syllable
by syllable.</p>
<p class="c010">The train crept on, with slowly gathering momentum,
through the station. Happening to look out of the window
at this moment, Gumbril saw the name of the place painted
across a lamp. It was Robertsbridge. He made a loud,
inarticulate noise, flung open the door of the compartment,
stepped out on to the footboard and jumped. He landed
safely on the platform, staggered forward a few paces with
his acquired momentum and came at last to a halt. A
hand reached out and closed the swinging door of his compartment
and, an instant afterwards, through the window,
a face that, at a distance, looked more than ever like the
face of the Emperor Francis Joseph, looked back towards
the receding platform. The mouth opened and shut; no
words were audible. Standing on the platform, Gumbril
made a complicated pantomime, signifying his regret by
shrugging his shoulders and placing his hand on his heart;
urging in excuse for his abrupt departure the necessity under
which he laboured of alighting at this particular station—which
he did by pointing at the name on the boards and
lamps, then at himself, then at the village across the fields.
The old gentleman waved his hand, which still held, Gumbril
noticed, the notebook in which he had been writing. Then
the train carried him out of sight. There went the only
case of old brandy he was ever likely to possess, thought
<span class="pageno" id="Page_248">248</span>Gumbril sadly, as he turned away. Suddenly, he remembered
Emily again; for a long time he had quite forgotten
her.</p>
<p class="c010">The cottage, when at last he found it, proved to be fully
as picturesque as he had imagined. And Emily, of course,
had gone, leaving, as might have been expected, no address.
He took the evening train back to London. The aridity
was now complete, and even the hope of a mirage had
vanished. There was no old gentleman to make a diversion.
The size of clergymen’s families, even the fate of Europe,
seemed unimportant now, were indeed perfectly indifferent
to him.</p>

<h2 class="c008">CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
</div>
<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c009">Two hundred and thirteen Sloane Street. The
address, Rosie reflected, as she vaporized synthetic
lilies of the valley over all her sinuous
person, was decidedly a good one. It argued a reasonable
prosperity, attested a certain distinction. The knowledge
of his address confirmed her already high opinion of
the bearded stranger who had so surprisingly entered her
life, as though in fulfilment of all the fortune-tellers’
prophecies that ever were made; had entered, yes, and
intimately made himself at home. She had been delighted,
when the telegram came that morning, to think that at last
she was going to find out something more about this man of
mystery. For dark and mysterious he had remained,
remote even in the midst of the most intimate contacts.
Why, she didn’t even know his name. “Call me Toto,”
he had suggested, when she asked him what it was. And
Toto she had had to call him, for lack of anything more
definite or committal. But to-day he was letting her
further into his secret. Rosie was delighted. Her pink
underclothing, she decided, as she looked in the long glass,
was really ravishing. She examined herself, turning first
one way, then the other, looking over her shoulder to see
the effect from behind. She pointed a toe, bent and
straightened a knee, applauding the length of her legs
(“Most women,” Toto had said, “are like dachshunds”),
<span class="pageno" id="Page_250">250</span>their slenderness and plump suavity of form. In their
white stockings of Milanese silk they looked delicious; and
how marvellously, by the way, those Selfridge people had
mended those stockings by their new patent process! Absolutely
like new, and only charged four shillings. Well,
it was time to dress. Good-bye, then, to the pink underclothing
and the long white legs. She opened the wardrobe
door. The moving glass reflected, as it swung through
its half-circle, pink bed, rose-wreathed walls, little friends
of her own age, and the dying saint at his last communion.
Rosie selected the frock she had bought the other day at
one of those little shops in Soho, there they sell such smart
things so cheaply to a clientage of minor actresses and
cocottes. Toto hadn’t seen it yet. She looked extremely
distinguished in it. The little hat, with its inch of veil
hanging like a mask, unconcealing and inviting, from the
brim, suited her to perfection. One last dab of powder,
one last squirt of synthetic lilies of the valley, and she
was ready. She closed the door behind her. St. Jerome
was left to communicate in the untenanted pinkness.</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Mercaptan sat at his writing-table—an exquisitely
amusing affair in papier mâché, inlaid with floral decorations
in mother-of-pearl and painted with views of Windsor
Castle and Tintern in the romantic manner of Prince
Albert’s later days—polishing to its final and gem-like
perfection one of his middle articles. It was on a splendid
subject—the ‘Jus Primæ Noctis, or Droit du Seigneur’—“that
delicious <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">droit</span></i>,” wrote Mr. Mercaptan, “on which,
one likes to think, the Sovereigns of England insist so firmly
in their motto, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dieu et mon Droit—de Seigneur</span></i>.” That
was charming, Mr. Mercaptan thought, as he read it through.
And he liked that bit which began elegiacally: “But,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_251">251</span>alas! the Right of the First Night belongs to a Middle Age
as mythical, albeit happily different, as those dismal epochs
invented by Morris or by Chesterton. The Lord’s right,
as we prettily imagine it, is a figment of the baroque imagination
of the seventeenth century. It never existed. Or at
least it did exist, but as something deplorably different
from what we love to picture it.” And he went on,
eruditely, to refer to that Council of Carthage which, in
398, demanded of the faithful that they should be continent
on their wedding-night. It was the Lord’s right—the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">droit</span></i> of a heavenly Seigneur. On this text of fact, Mr.
Mercaptan went on to preach a brilliant sermon on that
melancholy sexual perversion known as continence. How
much happier we all should be if the real historical <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">droit
du Seigneur</span></i> had in fact been the mythical right of our
‘pretty prurient imaginations’! He looked forward to a
golden age when all should be seigneurs possessing rights
that should have broadened down into universal liberty.
And so on. Mr. Mercaptan read through his creation with
a smile of satisfaction on his face. Every here and there
he made a careful correction in red ink. Over ‘pretty
prurient imaginations’ his pen hung for a full minute in
conscientious hesitation. Wasn’t it perhaps a little too
strongly alliterative, a shade, perhaps, cheap? Perhaps
‘pretty lascivious’ or ‘delicate prurient’ would be better.
He repeated the alternatives several times, rolling the sound
of them round his tongue, judicially, like a tea-taster.
In the end, he decided that ‘pretty prurient’ was right.
‘Pretty prurient’—they were the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mots justes</span></i>, decidedly,
without a question.</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Mercaptan had just come to this decision and his
poised pen was moving farther down the page, when he was
<span class="pageno" id="Page_252">252</span>disturbed by the sound of arguing voices in the corridor,
outside his room.</p>
<p class="c010">“What is it, Mrs. Goldie?” he called irritably, for it
was not difficult to distinguish his housekeeper’s loud and
querulous tones. He had given orders that he was not to be
disturbed. In these critical moments of correction one
needed such absolute tranquillity.</p>
<p class="c010">But Mr. Mercaptan was to have no tranquillity this
afternoon. The door of his sacred boudoir was thrown
rudely open, and there strode in, like a Goth into the
elegant marble vomitorium of Petronius Arbiter, a haggard
and dishevelled person whom Mr. Mercaptan recognized,
with a certain sense of discomfort, as Casimir Lypiatt.</p>
<p class="c010">“To what do I owe the <em>pleasure</em> of this unexpected...?”
Mr. Mercaptan began with an essay in
offensive courtesy.</p>
<p class="c010">But Lypiatt, who had no feeling for the finer shades,
coarsely interrupted him. “Look here, Mercaptan,” he
said. “I want to have a talk with you.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Delighted, I’m sure,” Mr. Mercaptan replied. “And
<em>what</em>, may I ask, about?” He knew, of course, perfectly
well; and the prospect of the talk disturbed him.</p>
<p class="c010">“About this,” said Lypiatt; and he held out what looked
like a roll of paper.</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Mercaptan took the roll and opened it out. It was a
copy of the <cite>Weekly World</cite>. “Ah!” said Mr. Mercaptan,
in a tone of delighted surprise, “<cite>The World</cite>. You have
read my little article?”</p>
<p class="c010">“That was what I wanted to talk to you about,” said
Lypiatt.</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Mercaptan modestly laughed. “It hardly deserves
it,” he said.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_253">253</span>Preserving a calm of expression which was quite unnatural
to him, and speaking in a studiedly quiet voice, Lypiatt
pronounced with careful deliberation: “It is a disgusting,
malicious, ignoble attack on me,” he said.</p>
<p class="c010">“Come, <em>come</em>!” protested Mr. Mercaptan. “A critic
must be allowed to criticize.”</p>
<p class="c010">“But there are limits,” said Lypiatt.</p>
<p class="c010">“Oh, I <em>quite</em> agree,” Mr. Mercaptan eagerly conceded.
“But, after all, Lypiatt, you can’t pretend that I have
come anywhere near those limits. If I had called you a
<em>mur</em>derer, or even an <em>adul</em>terer—then, I admit, you would
have some cause to complain. But I haven’t. There’s
nothing like a personality in the whole thing.”</p>
<p class="c010">Lypiatt laughed derisively, and his face went all to pieces,
like a pool of water into which a stone is suddenly dropped.</p>
<p class="c010">“You’ve merely said I was insincere, an actor, a mountebank,
a quack, raving fustian, spouting mock heroics. That’s
all.”</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Mercaptan put on the expression of one who feels
himself injured and misunderstood. He shut his eyes, he
flapped deprecatingly with his hand. “I <em>merely</em> suggested,”
he said, “that you protest <em>too</em> much. You defeat your
own ends; you lose emphasis by trying to be over-emphatic.
All this <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">folie de grandeur</span></i>, all this hankering after <em>terribiltà</em>——”
sagely Mr. Mercaptan shook his head, “it’s led
so <em>many</em> people astray. And, in any case, you can’t <em>really</em>
expect <em>me</em> to find it very sympathetic.” Mr. Mercaptan
uttered a little laugh and looked affectionately round his
boudoir, his retired and perfumed poutery within whose
walls so much civilization had finely flowered. He looked
at his magnificent sofa, gilded and carved, upholstered in
white satin, and so deep—for it was a great square piece of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_254">254</span>furniture, almost as broad as it was long—that when you
sat right back, you had of necessity to lift your feet from
the floor and recline at length. It was under the white
satin that Crébillon’s spirit found, in these late degenerate
days, a sympathetic home. He looked at his exquisite
Condor fans over the mantelpiece; his lovely Marie
Laurencin of two young girls, pale-skinned and berry-eyed,
walking embraced in a shallow myopic landscape amid a
troop of bounding heraldic dogs. He looked at his cabinet
of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bibelots</span></i> in the corner where the nigger mask and the
superb Chinese phallus in sculptured rock crystal contrasted
so amusingly with the Chelsea china, the little ivory
Madonna, which might be a fake, but in any case was quite
as good as any mediæval French original, and the Italian
medals. He looked at his comical writing-desk in shining
black papier mâché and mother-of-pearl; he looked at his
article on the “Jus Primæ Noctis,” black and neat on the
page, with the red corrections attesting his tireless search
for, and his, he flattered himself, almost invariable discovery
of, the inevitable word. No, really, one couldn’t expect
<em>him</em> to find Lypiatt’s notions very sympathetic.</p>
<p class="c010">“But I don’t expect you to,” said Lypiatt, “and, good
God! I don’t want you to. But you call me insincere.
That’s what I can’t and won’t stand. How dare you do
that?” His voice was growing louder.</p>
<p class="c010">Once more Mr. Mercaptan deprecatingly flapped. “At
the most,” he corrected, “I said that there was a certain
look of insincerity about some of the pictures. Hardly
avoidable, indeed, in work of this kind.”</p>
<p class="c010">Quite suddenly, Lypiatt lost his self-control. All the
accumulated anger and bitterness of the last days burst out.
His show had been a hopeless failure. Not a picture sold,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_255">255</span>a press that was mostly bad, or, when good, that had praised
for the wrong, the insulting reasons. “Bright and effective
work.” “Mr. Lypiatt would make an excellent stage
designer.” Damn them! damn them! And then, when
the dailies had all had their yelp, here was Mercaptan in
the <cite>Weekly World</cite> taking him as a text for what was practically
an essay on insincerity in art. “How dare you?” he
furiously shouted. “You—how dare you talk about sincerity?
What can you know about sincerity, you disgusting
little bug!” And avenging himself on the person of Mr.
Mercaptan against the world that had neglected him,
against the fate that had denied him his rightful share of
talent, Lypiatt sprang up and, seizing the author of the
“Jus Primæ Noctis” by the shoulders, he shook him, he
bumped him up and down in his chair, he cuffed him over
the head. “How can you have the impudence,” he asked,
letting go of his victim, but still standing menacingly over
him, “to touch anything that even attempts to be decent
and big?” All these years, these wretched years of poverty
and struggle and courageous hope and failure and repeated
disappointment; and now this last failure, more complete
than all. He was trembling with anger; at least one forgot
unhappiness while one was angry.</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Mercaptan had recovered from his first terrified
surprise. “Really, <em>really</em>” he repeated, “<em>too</em> barbarous.
Scuffling like hobbledehoys.”</p>
<p class="c010">“If you knew,” Lypiatt began; but he checked himself.
If you knew, he was going to say, what those things had cost
me, what they meant, what thought, what passion——But
how could Mercaptan understand? And it would sound
as though he were appealing to this creature’s sympathy.
“Bug!” he shouted instead, “bug!” And he struck out
<span class="pageno" id="Page_256">256</span>again with the flat of his hand. Mr. Mercaptan put up his
hands and ducked away from the slaps, blinking.</p>
<p class="c010">“Really,” he protested, “<em>really</em>....”</p>
<p class="c010">Insincere? Perhaps it was half true. Lypiatt seized his
man more furiously than before and shook him, shook him.
“And then that vile insult about the vermouth advertisement,”
he cried out. That had rankled. Those flaring,
vulgar posters! “You thought you could mock me and
spit at me with impunity, did you? I’ve stood it so long,
you thought I’d always stand it? Was that it? But
you’re mistaken.” He lifted his fist. Mr. Mercaptan
cowered away, raising his arm to protect his head. “Vile
bug of a coward,” said Lypiatt, “why don’t you defend
yourself like a man? You can only be dangerous with
words. Very witty and spiteful and cutting about those
vermouth posters, wasn’t it? But you wouldn’t dare to
fight me if I challenged you.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Well, as a matter of <em>fact</em>,” said Mr. Mercaptan, peering
up from under his defences, “I didn’t invent <em>that</em> particular
piece of criticism. I borrowed the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">apéritif</span></i>.” He laughed
feebly, more canary than bull.</p>
<p class="c010">“You borrowed it, did you?” Lypiatt contemptuously
repeated. “And who from, may I ask?” Not that it
interested him in the least to know.</p>
<p class="c010">“Well, if you really <em>want</em> to know,” said Mr. Mercaptan,
“it was from our friend Myra Viveash.”</p>
<p class="c010">Lypiatt stood for a moment without speaking, then
putting his menacing hand in his pocket, he turned away.
“Oh!” he said noncommittally, and was silent again.</p>
<p class="c010">Relieved, Mr. Mercaptan sat up in his chair; with the
palm of his right hand he smoothed his dishevelled head.</p>
<p class="c010">Airily, outside in the sunshine, Rosie walked down Sloane
<span class="pageno" id="Page_257">257</span>Street, looking at the numbers on the doors of the houses.
A hundred and ninety-nine, two hundred, two hundred and
one—she was getting near now. Perhaps all the people
who passed, strolling so easily and elegantly and disengagedly
along, perhaps they all of them carried behind their eyes
a secret, as delightful and amusing as hers. Rosie liked to
think so; it made life more exciting. How nonchalantly
distinguished, Rosie reflected, she herself must look. Would
any one who saw her now, sauntering along like this, would
any one guess that, ten houses farther down the street, a
young poet, or at least very nearly a young poet, was waiting,
on the second floor, eagerly for her arrival? Of course
they wouldn’t and couldn’t guess! That was the fun and
the enormous excitement of the whole thing. Formidable
in her light-hearted detachment, formidable in the passion
which at will she could give rein to and check again, the
great lady swam beautifully along through the sunlight to
satisfy her caprice. Like Diana, she stooped over the
shepherd boy. Eagerly the starving young poet waited,
waited in his garret. Two hundred and twelve, two hundred
and thirteen. Rosie looked at the entrance and was reminded
that the garret couldn’t after all be very sordid,
nor the young poet absolutely starving. She stepped in
and, standing in the hall, looked at the board with the
names. Ground floor: Mrs. Budge. First floor: F. de
M. Rowbotham. Second floor: P. Mercaptan.</p>
<p class="c010">P. Mercaptan.... But it was a charming name, a
romantic name, a real young poet’s name! Mercaptan—she
felt more than ever pleased with her selection. The
fastidious lady could not have had a happier caprice. Mercaptan ...
Mercaptan.... She wondered what the P.
stood for. Peter, Philip, Patrick, Pendennis even? She
<span class="pageno" id="Page_258">258</span>could hardly have guessed that Mr. Mercaptan’s father,
the eminent bacteriologist, had insisted, thirty-four years
ago, on calling his first-born ‘Pasteur.’</p>
<p class="c010">A little tremulous, under her outward elegant calm, Rosie
mounted the stairs. Twenty-five steps to the first floor—one
flight of thirteen, which was rather disagreeably
ominous, and one of twelve. Then two flights of eleven,
and she was on the second landing, facing a front door, a
bell-push like a round eye, a brass name-plate. For a
great lady thoroughly accustomed to this sort of thing, she
felt her heart beating rather unpleasantly fast. It was
those stairs, no doubt. She halted a moment, took two deep
breaths, then pushed the bell.</p>
<p class="c010">The door was opened by an aged servant of the most
forbiddingly respectable appearance.</p>
<p class="c010">“Mr. Mercaptan at home?”</p>
<p class="c010">The person at the door burst at once into a long, rambling,
angry complaint, but precisely about what Rosie could not
for certain make out. Mr. Mercaptan had left orders,
she gathered, that he wasn’t to be disturbed. But some
one had come and disturbed him, “fairly shoved his way
in, so rude and inconsiderate,” all the same. And now he’d
been once disturbed, she didn’t see why he shouldn’t be
disturbed again. But she didn’t know what things were
coming to if people fairly shoved their way in like that.
Bolshevism, she called it.</p>
<p class="c010">Rosie murmured her sympathies, and was admitted into
a dark hall. Still querulously denouncing the Bolsheviks
who came shoving in, the person led the way down a corridor
and, throwing open a door, announced, in a tone of
grievance: “A lady to see you, Master Paster”—for Mrs.
Goldie was an old family retainer, and one of the few who
<span class="pageno" id="Page_259">259</span>knew the Secret of Mr. Mercaptan’s Christian name, one
of the fewer still who were privileged to employ it. Then,
as soon as Rosie had stepped across the threshold, she cut
off her retreat with a bang and went off, muttering all the
time, towards her kitchen.</p>
<p class="c010">It certainly wasn’t a garret. Half a glance, the first
whiff of pot-pourri, the feel of the carpet beneath her feet,
had been enough to prove that. But it was not the room
which occupied Rosie’s attention, it was its occupants.
One of them, thin, sharp-featured and, in Rosie’s very young
eyes, quite old, was standing with an elbow on the mantelpiece.
The other, sleeker and more genial in appearance,
was sitting in front of a writing-desk near the window.
And neither of them—Rosie glanced desperately from
one to the other, hoping vainly that she might have overlooked
a blond beard—neither of them was Toto.</p>
<p class="c010">The sleek man at the writing-desk got up, advanced to
meet her.</p>
<p class="c010">“An unexpected pleasure,” he said, in a voice that alternately
boomed and fluted. “<em>Too</em> delightful! But to
what do I owe——? <em>Who</em>, may I ask——?”</p>
<p class="c010">He had held out his hand; automatically Rosie proffered
hers. The sleek man shook it with cordiality, almost with
tenderness.</p>
<p class="c010">“I ... I think I must have made a mistake,” she said.
“Mr. Mercaptan...?”</p>
<p class="c010">The sleek man smiled. “I am Mr. Mercaptan.”</p>
<p class="c010">“You live on the second floor?”</p>
<p class="c010">“I never laid claims to being a mathematician,” said
the sleek man, smiling as though to applaud himself, “but
I have always calculated that ...” he hesitated ...
“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">enfin, que ma demeure se trouve, en effet</span></i>, on the second
<span class="pageno" id="Page_260">260</span>floor. Lypiatt will bear me out, I’m sure.” He turned
to the thin man, who had not moved from the fireplace,
but had stood all the time motionlessly, his elbow on the
mantelpiece, looking gloomily at the ground.</p>
<p class="c010">Lypiatt looked up. “I must be going,” he said abruptly.
And he walked towards the door. Like vermouth posters,
like vermouth posters!—so that was Myra’s piece of mockery!
All his anger had sunk like a quenched flame. He was altogether
quenched, put out with unhappiness.</p>
<p class="c010">Politely Mr. Mercaptan hurried across the room and
opened the door for him. “<em>Good</em>-bye, then,” he said
airily.</p>
<p class="c010">Lypiatt did not speak, but walked out into the hall. The
front door banged behind him.</p>
<p class="c010">“Well, <em>well</em>,” said Mr. Mercaptan, coming back across
the room to where Rosie was still irresolutely standing.
“Talk about the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">furor poeticus</span></i>! But <em>do</em> sit down, I beg
you. On Crébillon.” He indicated the vast white satin
sofa. “I call it Crébillon,” he explained, “because the
soul of that great writer undoubtedly tenants it, <em>undoubtedly</em>.
You know his book, of course? You know <cite>Le Sopha</cite>?”</p>
<p class="c010">Sinking into Crébillon’s soft lap, Rosie had to admit that
she didn’t know <cite>Le Sopha</cite>. She had begun to recover her
self-possession. If this wasn’t <em>the</em> young poet, it was certainly
<em>a</em> young poet. And a very peculiar one, too. As a
great lady she laughingly accepted the odd situation.</p>
<p class="c010">“Not know <cite>Le Sopha</cite>?” exclaimed Mr. Mercaptan.
“Oh! but, my dear and mysterious young lady, let me
lend you a copy of it at once. <em>No</em> education can be called
<em>complete</em> without a knowledge of that divine book.” He
darted to the bookshelf and came back with a small volume
bound in white vellum. “The hero’s soul,” he explained,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_261">261</span>handing her the volume, “passes, by the laws of metempsychosis,
into a sofa. He is doomed to remain a sofa until
such time as two persons consummate upon his bosom their
reciprocal and equal loves. The book is the record of the
poor sofa’s hopes and disappointments.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Dear me!” said Rosie, looking at the title-page.</p>
<p class="c010">“But now,” said Mr. Mercaptan, sitting down beside her
on the edge of Crébillon, “won’t you please explain? To
what happy quiproquo do I owe this sudden and altogether
delightful invasion of my privacy?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Well,” said Rosie, and hesitated. It was really rather
difficult to explain. “I was to meet a friend of mine.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Quite so,” said Mr. Mercaptan encouragingly.</p>
<p class="c010">“Who sent me a telegram,” Rosie went on.</p>
<p class="c010">“He sent you a telegram!” Mr. Mercaptan echoed.</p>
<p class="c010">“Changing the—the place we had fixed and telling me
to meet him at this address.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Here?”</p>
<p class="c010">Rose nodded. “On the s—second floor,” she made it
more precise.</p>
<p class="c010">“But <em>I</em> live on the second floor,” said Mr. Mercaptan.
“You don’t mean to say your friend is also called Mercaptan
and lives here too?”</p>
<p class="c010">Rosie smiled. “I don’t know what he’s called,” she said
with a cool ironical carelessness that was genuinely <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grande
dame</span></i>.</p>
<p class="c010">“You don’t know his name?” Mr. Mercaptan gave a
roar and a squeal of delighted laughter. “But that’s <em>too</em>
good,” he said.</p>
<p class="c010">“S—second floor, he wrote in the telegram.” Rosie was
now perfectly at her ease. “When I saw your name, I
thought it was his name. I must say,” she added, looking
<span class="pageno" id="Page_262">262</span>sideways at Mr. Mercaptan and at once dropping the
magnolia petals of her eyelids, “it seemed to me a very
charming name.”</p>
<p class="c010">“You overwhelm me,” said Mr. Mercaptan, smiling all
over his cheerful, snouty face. “As for <em>your</em> name—I am
too discreet a <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">galantuomo</span></i> to ask. And, in any case, what
<em>does</em> it matter? A rose by any other name....”</p>
<p class="c010">“But, as a matter of fact,” she said, raising and lowering
once again her smooth, white lids, “my name does happen
to be Rose; or, at any rate, Rosie.”</p>
<p class="c010">“So you are sweet by right!” exclaimed Mr. Mercaptan,
with a pretty gallantry which he was the first to appreciate.
“Let’s order tea on the strength of it.” He jumped up
and rang the bell. “How I congratulate myself on this
astonishing piece of good fortune!”</p>
<p class="c010">Rosie said nothing. This Mr. Mercaptan, she thought,
seemed to be even more a man of the great artistic world
than Toto.</p>
<p class="c010">“What puzzles me,” he went on, “is why your anonymous
friend should have chosen my address out of all the
millions of others. He must know me, or, at any rate,
know about me.”</p>
<p class="c010">“I should imagine,” said Rosie, “that you have a lot
of friends.”</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Mercaptan laughed—the whole orchestra, from
bassoon to piccolo. “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Des amis, des amies</span></i>—with and without
the mute ‘e,’” he declared.</p>
<p class="c010">The aged and forbidding servant appeared at the door.</p>
<p class="c010">“Tea for two, Mrs. Goldie.”</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Goldie looked round the room suspiciously. “The
other gentleman’s gone, has he?” she asked. And having
assured herself of his absence, she renewed her complaint.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_263">263</span>“Shoving in like that,” she said. “Bolshevism, that’s
what I——”</p>
<p class="c010">“All right, all right, Mrs. Goldie. Let’s have our tea
as quickly as possible.” Mr. Mercaptan held up his hand,
authoritatively, with the gesture of a policeman controlling
the traffic.</p>
<p class="c010">“Very well, Master Paster.” Mrs. Goldie spoke with
resignation and departed.</p>
<p class="c010">“But tell me,” Mr. Mercaptan went on, “if it <em>isn’t</em> indiscreet—what
does your friend look like?”</p>
<p class="c010">“W—well,” Rosie answered, “he’s fair, and though he’s
quite young he wears a beard.” With her two hands she
indicated on her own unemphatic bosom the contours of
Toto’s broad blond fan.</p>
<p class="c010">“A beard! But, good heavens,” Mr. Mercaptan slapped
his thigh, “it’s Coleman, it’s obviously and undoubtedly
Coleman!”</p>
<p class="c010">“Well, whoever it was,” said Rosie severely, “he played
a very stupid sort of joke.”</p>
<p class="c010">“For which I thank him. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De tout mon cœur.</span></i>”</p>
<p class="c010">Rosie smiled and looked sideways. “All the same,” she
said, “I shall give him a piece of my mind.”</p>
<p class="c010">Poor Aunt Aggie! Oh, poor Aunt Aggie, indeed! In
the light of Mr. Mercaptan’s boudoir her hammered copper
and her leadless glaze certainly did look a bit comical.</p>
<p class="c010">After tea Mr. Mercaptan played cicerone in a tour of
inspection round the room. They visited the papier
mâché writing-desk, the Condor fans, the Marie Laurencin,
the 1914 edition of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Du Côté de chez Swann</span></i>, the Madonna
that probably was a fake, the nigger mask, the Chelsea
figures, the Chinese object of art in sculptured crystal,
the scale model of Queen Victoria in wax under a glass
<span class="pageno" id="Page_264">264</span>bell. Toto, it became clear, had been no more than a
forerunner; the definitive revelation was Mr. Mercaptan’s.
Yes, poor Aunt Aggie! And indeed, when Mr. Mercaptan
began to read her his little middle on the “Droit du
Seigneur,” it was poor everybody. Poor mother, with her
absurd, old-fashioned, prudish views; poor, earnest father,
with his Unitarianism, his <cite>Hibbert Journal</cite>, his letters to
the papers about the necessity for a spiritual regeneration.</p>
<p class="c010">“Bravo!” she cried from the depths of Crébillon. She
was leaning back in one corner, languid, serpentine, and at
ease, her feet in their mottled snake’s leather tucked up
under her. “Bravo!” she cried as Mr. Mercaptan finished
his reading and looked up for his applause.</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Mercaptan bowed.</p>
<p class="c010">“You express so exquisitely what we——” and waving
her hand in a comprehensive gesture, she pictured to herself
all the other fastidious ladies, all the marchionesses of
fable, reclining, as she herself at this moment reclined, on
upholstery of white satin, “what we all only feel and aren’t
clever enough to say.”</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Mercaptan was charmed. He got up from before
his writing-desk, crossed the room and sat down beside her
on Crébillon. “Feeling,” he said, “is the im<em>port</em>ant
thing.”</p>
<p class="c010">Rosie remembered that her father had once remarked,
in blank verse: ‘The things that matter happen in the
heart.’</p>
<p class="c010">“I quite agree,” she said.</p>
<p class="c010">Like movable raisins in the suet of his snouty face, Mr.
Mercaptan’s brown little eyes rolled amorous avowals.
He took Rosie’s hand and kissed it. Crébillon creaked
discreetly as he moved a little nearer.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_265">265</span>It was only the evening of the same day. Rosie lay on her
sofa—a poor, hire-purchase thing indeed, compared with
Mr. Mercaptan’s grand affair in white satin and carved
and gilded wood, but still a sofa—lay with her feet on the
arm of it and her long suave legs exposed, by the slipping
of the kimono, to the top of her stretched stockings. She
was reading the little vellum-jacketed volume of Crébillon,
which Mr. Mercaptan had given her when he said ‘good-bye’
(or rather, ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">À bientôt, mon amie</span></i>’); given, not lent,
as he had less generously offered at the beginning of their
afternoon; given with the most graceful of allusive dedications
inscribed on the fly-leaf:</p>
<div class="nf-center-c0">
<div class="nf-center">
<div>To</div>
<div class="c006">BY-NO-OTHER-NAME-AS-SWEET,</div>
<div class="c006"><span class="sc">With Gratitude</span>,</div>
<div class="c006"><span class="fss">FROM</span></div>
<div class="c006">CRÉBILLON DELIVERED.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="c010"><i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">À bientôt</span></i>—she had promised to come again very soon.
She thought of the essay on the “Jus Primæ Noctis”—ah!
what we’ve all been feeling and none of us clever
enough to say. We on the sofas, ruthless, lovely and
fastidious....</p>
<p class="c010">“I am proud to constitute myself”—Mr. Mercaptan
had said of it—“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l’esprit d’escalier des dames galantes</span></i>.”</p>
<p class="c010">Rosie was not quite sure what he meant; but it certainly
sounded very witty indeed.</p>
<p class="c010">She read the book slowly. Her French, indeed, wasn’t
good enough to permit her to read it anyhow else. She
wished it were better. Perhaps it if were better she wouldn’t
be yawning like this. It was disgraceful: she pulled herself
<span class="pageno" id="Page_266">266</span>together. Mr. Mercaptan had said that, it was a
masterpiece.</p>
<p class="c010">In his study, Shearwater was trying to write his paper
on the regulative functions of the kidneys. He was not
succeeding.</p>
<p class="c010">Why wouldn’t she see me yesterday? he kept wondering.
With anguish he suspected other lovers; desired her, in
consequence, the more. Gumbril had said something, he
remembered, that night they had met her by the coffee-stall.
What was it? He wished now that he had listened
more attentively.</p>
<p class="c010">She’s bored with me. Already. It was obvious.</p>
<p class="c010">Perhaps he was too rustic for her. Shearwater looked
at his hands. Yes, the nails <em>were</em> dirty. He took an orange
stick out of his waistcoat pocket and began to clean them.
He had bought a whole packet of orange sticks that
morning.</p>
<p class="c010">Determinedly he took up his pen. “The hydrogen ion
concentration in the blood ...” he began a new paragraph.
But he got no further than the first seven words.</p>
<p class="c010">If, he began thinking with a frightful confusion, if—if—if——
Past conditionals, hopelessly past. He might
have been brought up more elegantly; his father, for
example, might have been a barrister instead of a barrister’s
clerk. He mightn’t have had to work so hard when he was
young; might have been about more, danced more, seen
more young women. If he had met her years ago—during
the war, should one say, dressed in the uniform of a lieutenant
in the Guards....</p>
<p class="c010">He had pretended that he wasn’t interested in women;
that they had no effect on him; that, in fact, he was above
that sort of thing. Imbecile! He might as well have said
<span class="pageno" id="Page_267">267</span>that he was above having a pair of kidneys. He had only
consented to admit, graciously, that they were a physiological
necessity.</p>
<p class="c010">O God, what a fool he had been!</p>
<p class="c010">And then, what about Rosie? What sort of a life had
she been having while he was being above that sort of thing?
Now he came to think of it, he really knew nothing about
her, except that she had been quite incapable of learning
correctly, even by heart, the simplest facts about the
physiology of frogs. Having found that out, he had really
given up exploring further. How could he have been so
stupid?</p>
<p class="c010">Rosie had been in love with him, he supposed. Had he
been in love with her? No. He had taken care not to
be. On principle. He had married her as a measure of
intimate hygiene; out of protective affection, too, certainly
out of affection; and a little for amusement, as
one might buy a puppy.</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Viveash had opened his eyes; seeing her, he had
also begun to notice Rosie. It seemed to him that he had
been a loutish cad as well as an imbecile.</p>
<p class="c010">What should he do about it? He sat for a long time
wondering.</p>
<p class="c010">In the end he decided that the best thing would be to go
and tell Rosie all about it, all about everything.</p>
<p class="c010">About Mrs. Viveash too? Yes, about Mrs. Viveash too.
He would get over Mrs. Viveash more easily and more
rapidly if he did. And he would begin to try and find out
about Rosie. He would explore her. He would discover
all the other things besides an incapacity to learn physiology
that were in her. He would discover her, he would quicken
his affection for her into something livelier and more urgent.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_268">268</span>And they would begin again; more satisfactorily this time;
with knowledge and understanding; wise from their
experience.</p>
<p class="c010">Shearwater got up from his chair before the writing-table,
lurched pensively towards the door, bumping into
the revolving bookcase and the arm-chair as he went, and
walked down the passage to the drawing-room. Rosie
did not turn her head as he came in, but went on reading
without changing her position, her slippered feet still
higher than her head, her legs still charmingly avowing
themselves.</p>
<p class="c010">Shearwater came to a halt in front of the empty fireplace.
He stood there with his back to it, as though warming
himself before an imaginary flame. It was, he felt, the
safest, the most strategic point from which to talk.</p>
<p class="c010">“What are you reading?” he asked.</p>
<p class="c010">“<cite>Le Sopha</cite>,” said Rosie.</p>
<p class="c010">“What’s that?”</p>
<p class="c010">“What’s that?” Rosie scornfully echoed. “Why, it’s
one of the great French classics.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Who by?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Crébillon the younger.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Never heard of him,” said Shearwater. There was a
silence. Rosie went on reading.</p>
<p class="c010">“It just occurred to me,” Shearwater began again in his
rather ponderous, infelicitous way, “that you mightn’t
be very happy, Rosie.”</p>
<p class="c010">Rosie looked up at him and laughed. “What put that
into your head?” she asked. “<em>I</em>’m perfectly happy.”</p>
<p class="c010">Shearwater was left a little at a loss. “Well, I’m very
glad to hear it,” he said. “I only thought ... that
perhaps <em>you</em> might think ... that <em>I</em> rather neglected you.”</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_269">269</span>Rosie laughed again. “What is all this about?” she
said.</p>
<p class="c010">“I have it rather on my conscience,” said Shearwater.
“I begin to see ... something has made me see ...
that I’ve not.... I don’t treat you very well....”</p>
<p class="c010">“But I don’t n—notice it, I assure you,” put in Rosie,
still smiling.</p>
<p class="c010">“I leave you out too much,” Shearwater went on with
a kind of desperation, running his fingers through his thick
brown hair. “We don’t share enough together. You’re
too much outside my life.”</p>
<p class="c010">“But after all,” said Rosie, “we are a civ—vilized
couple. We don’t want to live in one another’s pockets,
do we?”</p>
<p class="c010">“No, but we’re really no more than strangers,” said
Shearwater. “That isn’t right. And it’s my fault.
I’ve never tried to get into touch with your life. But you
did your best to understand mine ... at the beginning
of our marriage.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Oh, <em>then—n</em>!” said Rosie, laughing. “You found
out what a little idiot I was.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Don’t make a joke of it,” said Shearwater. “It isn’t
a joke. It’s very serious. I tell you, I’ve come to see how
stupid and inconsiderate and un-understanding I’ve been
with you. I’ve come to see quite suddenly. The fact is,”
he went on with a rush, like an uncorked fountain, “I’ve
been seeing a woman recently whom I like very much, and
who doesn’t like me.” Speaking of Mrs. Viveash, unconsciously
he spoke her language. For Mrs. Viveash
people always euphemistically ‘liked’ one another rather a
lot, even when it was a case of the most frightful and
excruciating passion, the most complete abandonments.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_270">270</span>“And somehow that’s made me see a lot of things which
I’d been blind to before—blind deliberately, I suppose.
It’s made me see, among other things, that I’ve really been
to blame towards you, Rosie.”</p>
<p class="c010">Rosie listened with an astonishment which she perfectly
disguised. So James was embarking on his little affairs,
was he? It seemed incredible, and also, as she looked at
her husband’s face—the face behind its bristlingly manly
mask of a harassed baby—also rather pathetically absurd.
She wondered who it could be. But she displayed no
curiosity. She would find out soon enough.</p>
<p class="c010">“I’m sorry you should have been unhappy about it,”
she said.</p>
<p class="c010">“It’s finished now.” Shearwater made a decided little
gesture.</p>
<p class="c010">“Ah, no!” said Rosie. “You should persevere.”
She looked at him, smiling.</p>
<p class="c010">Shearwater was taken aback by this display of easy detachment.
He had imagined the conversation so very differently,
as something so serious, so painful and, at the same time,
so healing and soothing, that he did not know how to go on.
“But I thought,” he said hesitatingly, “that you ... that
we ... after this experience ... I would try to get
closer to you....” (Oh, it sounded ridiculous!) ...
“We might start again, from a different place, so to speak.”</p>
<p class="c010">“But, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cher ami</span></i>,” protested Rosie, with the inflection
and in the preferred tongue of Mr. Mercaptan, “you can’t
seriously expect us to do the Darby and Joan business,
can you? You’re distressing yourself quite unnecessarily
on my account. I don’t find you neglect me or anything
like it. You have your life—naturally. And I have
mine. We don’t get in one another’s way.”</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_271">271</span>“But do you think that’s the ideal sort of married life?”
asked Shearwater.</p>
<p class="c010">“It’s obviously the most civ—vilized,” Rosie answered,
laughing.</p>
<p class="c010">Confronted by Rosie’s civilization, Shearwater felt
helpless.</p>
<p class="c010">“Well, if you don’t want,” he said. “I’d hoped ...
I’d thought....”</p>
<p class="c010">He went back to his study to think things over. The
more he thought them over, the more he blamed himself.
And incessantly the memory of Mrs. Viveash tormented
him.</p>
<div class="chapter">
<span class="pageno" id="Page_272">272</span>
<h2 class="c008">CHAPTER XIX</h2>
</div>
<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c009">After leaving Mr. Mercaptan, Lypiatt had gone
straight home. The bright day seemed to deride
him. With its shining red omnibuses, its parasols,
its muslin girls, its young-leaved trees, its bands at the
street corners, it was too much of a garden party to be
tolerable. He wanted to be alone. He took a cab back
to the studio. He couldn’t afford it, of course; but what
did that matter, what did that matter now?</p>
<p class="c010">The cab drove slowly and as though with reluctance
down the dirty mews. He paid it off, opened his little
door between the wide stable doors, climbed the steep
ladder of his stairs and was at home. He sat down and
tried to think.</p>
<p class="c010">“Death, death, death, death,” he kept repeating to
himself, moving his lips as though he were praying. If he
said the word often enough, if he accustomed himself completely
to the idea, death would come almost by itself; he
would know it already, while he was still alive, he would
pass almost without noticing out of life into death. Into
death, he thought, into death. Death like a well. The
stone falls, falls, second after second; and at last there is
a sound, a far-off, horrible sound of death and then nothing
more. The well at Carisbrooke, with a donkey to wind the
wheel that pulls up the bucket of water, of icy water....
He thought for a long time of the well of death.</p>
<p class="c010">Outside in the mews a barrel-organ struck up the tune
<span class="pageno" id="Page_273">273</span>of ‘Where do flies go in the winter-time?’ Lypiatt lifted
his head to listen. He smiled to himself. ‘Where <em>do</em> flies
go?’ The question asked itself with a dramatic, a tragical
appositeness. At the end of everything—the last ludicrous
touch. He saw it all from outside. He pictured himself
sitting there alone, broken. He looked at his hand lying
limp on the table in front of him. It needed only the
stigma of the nail to make it the hand of a dead Christ.</p>
<p class="c010">There, he was making literature of it again. Even now.
He buried his face in his hands. His mind was full of
twisted darkness, of an unspeakable, painful confusion. It
was too difficult, too difficult.</p>
<p class="c010">The inkpot, he found when he wanted to begin writing,
contained nothing but a parched black sediment. He had
been meaning for days past to get some more ink; and he
had always forgotten. He would have to write in pencil.</p>
<p class="c010">“Do you remember,” he wrote, “do you remember,
Myra, that time we went down into the country—you
remember—under the Hog’s Back at that little inn they
were trying to make pretentious? ‘Hotel Bull’—do you
remember? How we laughed over the Hotel Bull! And
how we liked the country outside its doors! All the world
in a few square miles. Chalk-pits and blue butterflies on
the Hog’s Back. And at the foot of the hill, suddenly,
the sand; the hard, yellow sand with those queer caves,
dug when and by what remote villains at the edge of the
Pilgrims’ Way? the fine grey sand on which the heather
of Puttenham Common grows. And the flagstaff and the
inscription marking the place where Queen Victoria stood
to look at the view. And the enormous sloping meadows
round Compton and the thick, dark woods. And the lakes,
the heaths, the Scotch firs at Cutt Mill. The forests of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_274">274</span>Shackleford. There was everything. Do you remember
how we enjoyed it all? I did, in any case. I was happy
during those three days. And I loved you, Myra. And I
thought you might, you might perhaps, some day, love me.
You didn’t. And my love has only brought me unhappiness.
Perhaps it has been my fault. Perhaps I ought to
have known how to make you give me happiness. You
remember that wonderful sonnet of Michelangelo’s, where
he says that the loved woman is like a block of marble from
which the artist knows how to cut the perfect statue of his
dreams. If the statue turns out a bad one, if it’s death
instead of love that the lover gets—why, the fault lies in
the artist and in the lover, not in the marble, not in the
beloved.</p>

<p class="c012">Yes, it was my <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">basso ingegno</span></i>: my low genius which did not
know how to draw love from you, nor beauty from the
materials of which art is made. Ah, now you’ll smile to
yourself and say: Poor Casimir, he has come to admit that
at last? Yes, yes, I have come to admit everything. That
I couldn’t paint, I couldn’t write, I couldn’t make music.
That I was a charlatan and a quack. That I was a ridiculous
actor of heroic parts who deserved to be laughed at—and
<em>was</em> laughed at. But then every man is ludicrous if you
look at him from outside, without taking into account
<span class="pageno" id="Page_275">275</span>what’s going on in his heart and mind. You could turn
Hamlet into an epigrammatic farce with an inimitable scene
when he takes his adored mother in adultery. You could
make the wittiest Guy de Maupassant short story out of
the life of Christ, by contrasting the mad rabbi’s pretensions
with his abject fate. It’s a question of the point of
view. Every one’s a walking farce and a walking tragedy
at the same time. The man who slips on a banana-skin
and fractures his skull describes against the sky, as he falls,
the most richly comical arabesque. And you, Myra—what
do you suppose the unsympathetic gossips say of you?
What sort of a farce of the Boulevards is your life in their
eyes? For me, Myra, you seem to move all the time
through some nameless and incomprehensible tragedy. For
them you are what? Merely any sort of a wanton, with
amusing adventures. And what am I? A charlatan, a
quack, a pretentious, boasting, rhodomontading imbecile,
incapable of painting anything but vermouth posters.
(Why did that hurt so terribly? I don’t know. There
was no reason why you shouldn’t think so if you wanted
to.) I was all that,—and grotesquely laughable. And very
likely your laughter was justified, your judgment was true.
I don’t know. I can’t tell. Perhaps I am a charlatan.
Perhaps I’m insincere; boasting to others, deceiving myself.
I don’t know, I tell you. Everything is confusion in my
mind now. The whole fabric seems to have tumbled to
pieces; it lies in a horrible chaos. I can make no order
within myself. Have I lied to myself? have I acted and
postured the Great Man to persuade myself that I am one?
have I something in me, or nothing? have I ever achieved
anything of worth, anything that rhymed with my conceptions,
my dreams (for those were fine; of that, I <em>am</em>
<span class="pageno" id="Page_276">276</span>certain)? I look into the chaos that is my soul and, I tell
you, I don’t know, I don’t know. But what I do know
is that I’ve spent nearly twenty years now playing the
charlatan at whom you all laugh. That I’ve suffered, in
mind and in body too—almost from hunger, sometimes—in
order to play it. That I’ve struggled, that I’ve exultantly
climbed to the attack, that I’ve been thrown down—ah,
many times!—that I’ve picked myself up and started again.
Well, I suppose all that’s ludicrous, if you like to think of
it that way. It is ludicrous that a man should put himself
to prolonged inconvenience for the sake of something which
doesn’t really exist at all. It’s exquisitely comic, I can see.
I can see it in the abstract, so to speak. But in this particular
case, you must remember I’m not a dispassionate
observer. And if I am overcome now, it is not with
laughter. It is with an indescribable unhappiness, with
the bitterness of death itself. Death, death, death. I
repeat the word to myself, again and again. I think of
death, I try to imagine it, I hang over it, looking down,
where the stones fall and fall and there is one horrible noise,
and then silence again; looking down into the well of
death. It is so deep that there is no glittering eye of water
to be seen at the bottom. I have no candle to send down.
It is horrible, but I do not want to go on living. Living
would be worse than....”</p>
<p class="c010">Lypiatt was reaching out for another sheet of paper when
he was startled to hear the sound of feet on the stairs. He
turned towards the door. His heart beat with violence.
He was filled with a strange sense of apprehension. In
terror he awaited the approach of some unknown and
terrible being. The feet of the angel of death were on the
stairs. Up, up, up. Lypiatt felt himself trembling as the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_277">277</span>sound came nearer. He knew for certain that in a few
seconds he was going to die. The hangmen had already
pinioned him; the soldiers of the firing squad had already
raised their rifles. One, two, ... he thought of Mrs.
Viveash standing, bare-headed, the wind blowing in her
hair, at the foot of the flagstaff from the site of which Queen
Victoria had admired the distant view of Selborne; he
thought of her dolorously smiling; he remembered that
once she had taken his head between her two hands and
kissed him: ‘Because you’re such a golden ass,’ she had
said, laughing. Three.... There was a little tap at the
door. Lypiatt pressed his hand over his heart. The door
opened.</p>
<p class="c010">A small, bird-like man with a long, sharp nose and eyes
as round and black and shining as buttons stepped into the
room.</p>
<p class="c010">“Mr. Lydgate, I presume?” he began. Then looked
at a card on which a name and address were evidently
written. “Lypiatt, I mean. A thousand pardons. Mr.
Lypiatt, I presume?”</p>
<p class="c010">Lypiatt leaned back in his chair and shut his eyes. His
face was as white as paper. He breathed hard and his
temples were wet with sweat, as though he had been running.</p>
<p class="c010">“I found the door down below open, so I came straight
up. I hope you’ll excuse....” The stranger smiled
apologetically.</p>
<p class="c010">“Who are you?” Lypiatt asked, reopening his eyes.
His heart was still beating hard; after the storm it calmed
itself slowly. He drew back from the brink of the fearful
well; the time had not yet come to plunge.</p>
<p class="c010">“My name,” said the stranger, “is Boldero, Herbert
Boldero. Our mutual friend Mr. Gumbril, Mr. Theodore
<span class="pageno" id="Page_278">278</span>Gumbril, junior,” he made it more precise, “suggested that
I might come and see you about a little matter in which
he and I are interested and in which perhaps you, too, might
be interested.”</p>
<p class="c010">Lypiatt nodded, without saying anything.</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Boldero, meanwhile, was turning his bright, bird-like
eyes about the studio. Mrs. Viveash’s portrait, all but
finished now, was clamped to the easel. He approached it,
a connoisseur.</p>
<p class="c010">“It reminds me very much,” he said, “of Bacosso. Very
much indeed, if I may say so. Also a little of ...” he
hesitated, trying to think of the name of that other fellow
Gumbril had talked about. But being unable to remember
the unimpressive syllables of Derain he played for safety
and said—“of Orpen.” Mr. Boldero looked inquiringly
at Lypiatt to see if that was right.</p>
<p class="c010">Lypiatt still spoke no word and seemed, indeed, not to
have heard what had been said.</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Boldero saw that it wasn’t much good talking about
modern art. This chap, he thought, looked as though something
were wrong with him. He hoped he hadn’t got
influenza. There was a lot of the disease about. “This
little affair I was speaking of,” he pursued, in another tone,
“is a little business proposition that Mr. Gumbril and I
have gone into together. A matter of pneumatic trousers,”
he waved his hand airily.</p>
<p class="c010">Lypiatt suddenly burst out laughing, an embittered
Titan. Where do flies go? Where do souls go? The
barrel-organ, and now pneumatic trousers! Then, as
suddenly, he was silent again. More literature? Another
piece of acting? “Go on,” he said, “I’m sorry.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Not at all, not at all,” said Mr. Boldero indulgently.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_279">279</span>“I know the idea does seem a little humorous, if I may say
so, at first. But I assure you, there’s money in it, Mr.
Lydgate—Mr. Lypiatt. Money!” Mr. Boldero paused
a moment dramatically. “Well,” he went on, “our idea
was to launch the new product with a good swingeing
publicity campaign. Spend a few thousands in the papers
and then get it good and strong into the Underground and
on the hoardings, along with Owbridge’s and John Bull
and the Golden Ballot. Now, for that, Mr. Lypiatt, we
shall need, as you can well imagine, a few good striking
pictures. Mr. Gumbril mentioned your name and suggested
I should come and see you to find out if you would
perhaps be agreeable to lending us your talent for this work.
And I may add, Mr. Lypiatt,” he spoke with real warmth,
“that having seen this example of your work”—he pointed
to the portrait of Mrs. Viveash—“I feel that you would
be eminently capable of....”</p>
<p class="c010">He did not finish the sentence; for at this moment
Lypiatt leapt up from his chair and, making a shrill, inarticulate,
animal noise, rushed on the financier, seized him
with both hands by the throat, shook him, threw him to
the floor, then picked him up again by the coat collar and
pushed him towards the door, kicking him as he went. A
final kick sent Mr. Boldero tobogganing down the steep
stairs. Lypiatt ran down after him; but Mr. Boldero
had picked himself up, had opened the front door, slipped
out, slammed it behind him, and was running up the mews
before Lypiatt could get to the bottom of the stairs.</p>
<p class="c010">Lypiatt opened the door and looked out. Mr. Boldero
was already far away, almost at the Piranesian arch. He
watched him till he was out of sight, then went upstairs
again and threw himself face downwards on his bed.</p>
<div class="chapter">
<span class="pageno" id="Page_280">280</span>
<h2 class="c008">CHAPTER XX</h2>
</div>
<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c009">Zoe ended the discussion by driving half an inch of
pen-knife into Coleman’s left arm and running out
of the flat, slamming the door behind her. Coleman
was used to this sort of thing; this sort of thing,
indeed, was what he was there for. Carefully he pulled
out the pen-knife which had remained sticking in his arm.
He looked at the blade and was relieved to see that it wasn’t
so dirty as might have been expected. He found some
cotton-wool, mopped up the blood as it oozed out, and
dabbed the wound with iodine. Then he set himself to
bandage it up. But to tie a bandage round one’s own
left arm is not easy. Coleman found it impossible to keep
the lint in place, impossible to get the bandage tight enough.
At the end of a quarter of an hour he had only succeeded
in smearing himself very copiously with blood, and the
wound was still unbound. He gave up the attempt and
contented himself with swabbing up the blood as it came
out.</p>
<p class="c010">“And forthwith came there out blood and water,” he
said aloud, and looked at the red stain on the cotton wool.
He repeated the words again and again, and at the fiftieth
repetition burst out laughing.</p>
<p class="c010">The bell in the kitchen suddenly buzzed. Who could
it be? He went to the front door and opened it. On the
landing outside stood a tall slender young woman with
slanting Chinese eyes and a wide mouth, elegantly dressed
<span class="pageno" id="Page_281">281</span>in a black frock piped with white. Keeping the cotton-wool
still pressed to his bleeding arm, Coleman bowed as gracefully
as he could.</p>
<p class="c010">“Do come in,” he said. “You are just in the nick of
time. I am on the point of bleeding to death. And
forthwith came there out blood and water. Enter, enter,”
he added, seeing the young woman still standing irresolutely
on the threshold.</p>
<p class="c010">“But I wanted to see Mr. Coleman,” she said, stammering
a little and showing her embarrassment by blushing.</p>
<p class="c010">“I am Mr. Coleman.” He took the cotton-wool for a
moment from his arm and looked with the air of a connoisseur
at the blood on it. “But I shall very soon cease to
be that individual unless you come and tie up my wounds.”</p>
<p class="c010">“But you’re not the Mr. Coleman I thought you were,”
said the young lady, still more embarrassed. “You have a
beard, it is true; but....”</p>
<p class="c010">“Then I must resign myself to quit this life, must I?”
He made a gesture of despair, throwing out both hands,
“Out, out brief Coleman. Out, damned spot,” and he
made as though to close the door.</p>
<p class="c010">The young lady checked him. “If you really need
tying up,” she said, “I’ll do it of course. I passed my
First-Aid Exam, in the war.”</p>
<p class="c010">Coleman reopened the door. “Saved!” he said. “Come
in.”</p>
<p class="c010">It had been Rosie’s original intention yesterday to go
straight on from Mr. Mercaptan’s to Toto’s. She would
see him at once, she would ask him what he meant by
playing that stupid trick on her. She would give him a good
talking to. She would even tell him that she would never
see him again. But, of course, if he showed himself
<span class="pageno" id="Page_282">282</span>sufficiently contrite and reasonably explanatory, she would
consent—oh, very reluctantly—to take him back into
favour. In the free, unprejudiced circles in which she now
moved, this sort of joke, she imagined, was a mere trifle.
It would be absurd to quarrel seriously about it. But still,
she was determined to give Toto a lesson.</p>
<p class="c010">When, however, she did finally leave Mr. Mercaptan’s
delicious boudoir, it was too late to think of going all the
way to Pimlico, to the address which Mr. Mercaptan had
given her. She decided to put it off till the next day.</p>
<p class="c010">And so the next day, duly, she had set out for Pimlico—to
Pimlico, and to see a man called Coleman! It seemed
rather dull and second-rate after Sloane Street and Mr.
Mercaptan. Poor Toto!—the sparkle of Mr. Mercaptan
had made him look rather tarnished. That essay on the
“Jus Primæ Noctis”—ah! Walking through the unsavoury
mazes of Pimlico, she thought of it, and, thinking
of it, smiled. Poor Toto! And also, she mustn’t forget,
stupid, malicious, idiotic Toto! She had made up her
mind exactly what she should say to him; she had even
made up her mind what Toto would say to her. And when
the scene was over they would go and dine at the Café
Royal—upstairs, where she had never been. And she would
make him rather jealous by telling him how much she had
liked Mr. Mercaptan; but not too jealous. Silence is
golden, as her father used to say when she used to fly into
tempers and wanted to say nasty things to everybody within
range. Silence, about some things, is certainly golden.</p>
<p class="c010">In the rather gloomy little turning off Lupus Street to
which she had been directed, Rosie found the number,
found, in the row of bells and cards, the name. Quickly
and decidedly she mounted the stairs.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_283">283</span>“Well,” she was going to say as soon as she saw him,
“I thought you were a civilized being.” Mr. Mercaptan
had dropped a hint that Coleman wasn’t really civilized;
a hint was enough for Rosie. “But I see,” she would go
on, “that I was mistaken. I don’t like to associate with
boors.” The fastidious lady had selected him as a young
poet, not as a ploughboy.</p>
<p class="c010">Well rehearsed, Rosie rang the bell. And then the door
had opened on this huge bearded Cossack of a man, who
smiled, who looked at her with bright, dangerous eyes,
who quoted the Bible and who was bleeding like a pig.
There was blood on his shirt, blood on his trousers, blood
on his hands, bloody finger-marks on his face; even the
blond fringe of his beard, she noticed, was dabbled here
and there with blood. It was too much, at first, even for
her aristocratic equanimity.</p>
<p class="c010">In the end, however, she followed him across a little
vestibule into a bright, whitewashed room empty of all
furniture but a table, a few chairs and a large box-spring
and mattress, which stood like an island in the middle of
the floor and served as bed or sofa as occasion required.
Over the mantelpiece was pinned a large photographic
reproduction of Leonardo’s study of the anatomy of love.
There were no other pictures on the walls.</p>
<p class="c010">“All the apparatus is here,” said Coleman, and he pointed
to the table. “Lint, bandages, cotton-wool, iodine, gauze,
oiled silk. I have them all ready in preparation for these
little accidents.”</p>
<p class="c010">“But do you often manage to cut yourself in the arm?”
asked Rosie. She took off her gloves and began to undo a
fresh packet of lint.</p>
<p class="c010">“One gets cut,” Coleman explained. “Little differences
<span class="pageno" id="Page_284">284</span>of opinion, you know. If your eye offend you, pluck
it out; love your neighbour as yourself. Argal: if his
eye offend you—you see? We live on Christian principles
here.”</p>
<p class="c010">“But who are ‘we’?” asked Rosie, giving the cut a
last dressing of iodine and laying a big square of lint over it.</p>
<p class="c010">“Merely myself and—how shall I put it?—my helpmate,”
Coleman answered. “Ah! you’re wonderfully
skilful at this business,” he went on. “You’re the real
hospital nurse type; all maternal instincts. When pain
and anguish wring the brow, an interesting mangle thou,
as we used to say in the good old days when the pun and the
Spoonerismus were in fashion.”</p>
<p class="c010">Rosie laughed. “Oh, I don’t spend all my time tying
up wounds,” she said, and turned her eyes for an instant
from the bandage. After the first surprise she was feeling
her cool self again.</p>
<p class="c010">“Brava!” cried Coleman. “You make them too, do
you? Make them first and cure them afterwards in the
grand old homœopathic way. Delightful! You see what
Leonardo has to say about it.” With his free hand he
pointed to the photograph over the mantelpiece.</p>
<p class="c010">Rosie, who had noticed the picture when she came
into the room, preferred not to look at it too closely a
second time. “I think it’s rather revolting,” she said, and
was very busy with the bandage.</p>
<p class="c010">“Ah! but that’s the point, that’s the whole point,”
said Coleman, and his clear blue eyes were alive with
dancing lights. “That’s the beauty of the grand passion.
It <em>is</em> revolting. You read what the Fathers of the Church
have to say about love. They’re the men. It was Odo
of Cluny, wasn’t it, who called woman a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">saccus stercoris</span></i>,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_285">285</span>a bag of muck. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Si quis enim considerat quæ intra nares et
quæ intra fauces et quæ intra ventrem lateant, sordes ubique
reperiet.</span></i>” The Latin rumbled like eloquent thunder
in Coleman’s mouth. “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Et si nec extremis digitis flegma
vel stercus tangere patimur, quomodo ipsum stercoris saccum
amplecti desideramus.</span></i>” He smacked his lips. “Magnificent!”
he said.</p>
<p class="c010">“I don’t understand Latin,” said Rosie, “and I’m glad
of it. And your bandage is finished. Look.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Interesting mangle!” Coleman smiled his thanks.
“But Bishop Odo, I fear, wouldn’t even have spared you;
not even for your good works. Still less for your good
looks, which would only have provoked him to dwell
with the more insistency on the visceral secrets which
they conceal.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Really,” Rosie protested. She would have liked to get
up and go away, but the Cossack’s blue eyes glittered at her
with such a strange expression and he smiled so enigmatically,
that she found herself still sitting where she was,
listening with a disgusted pleasure to his quick talk, his
screams of deliberate and appalling laughter.</p>
<p class="c010">“Ah!” he exclaimed, throwing up his hands, “what
sensualists these old fellows were! What a real voluptuous
feeling they had for dirt and gloom and sordidness and
boredom, and all the horrors of vice. They pretended they
were trying to dissuade people from vice by enumerating
its horrors. But they were really only making it more spicy
by telling the truth about it. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">O esca vermium, O massa
pulveris!</span></i> What nauseating embracements! To conjugate
the copulative verb, boringly, with a sack of tripes—what
could be more exquisitely and piercingly and
deliriously vile?” And he threw back his head and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_286">286</span>laughed; the blood-dabbled tips of his blond beard shook.
Rosie looked at them, fascinated with disgust.</p>
<p class="c010">“There’s blood on your beard,” she felt compelled to say.</p>
<p class="c010">“What of it? Why shouldn’t there be?” Coleman
asked.</p>
<p class="c010">Confused, Rosie felt herself blushing. “Only because
it’s rather unpl—leasant. I don’t know why. But it is.”</p>
<p class="c010">“What a reason for immediately falling into my arms!”
said Coleman. “To be kissed by a beard is bad enough
at any time. But by a bloody beard—imagine!”</p>
<p class="c010">Rosie shuddered.</p>
<p class="c010">“After all,” he said, “what interest or amusement is
there in doing the ordinary things in the obvious way?
Life <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au naturel</span></i>.” He shook his head. “You must have
garlic and saffron. Do you believe in God?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Not m—much,” said Rosie, smiling.</p>
<p class="c010">“I pity you. You must find existence dreadfully dull.
As soon as you do, everything becomes a thousand times
life-size. Phallic symbols five hundred feet high,” he lifted
his hand. “A row of grinning teeth you could run the
hundred yards on.” He grinned at her through his beard.
“Wounds big enough to let a coach-and-six drive into their
purulent recesses. Every slightest act eternally significant.
It’s only when you believe in God, and especially in hell,
that you can really begin enjoying life. For instance, when
in a few moments you surrender yourself to the importunities
of my bloody beard, how prodigiously much more
you’d enjoy it if you could believe you were committing
the sin against the Holy Ghost—if you kept thinking calmly
and dispassionately all the time the affair was going on:
All this is not only a horrible sin, it is also ugly, grotesque,
a mere defæcation, a——”</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_287">287</span>Rosie held up her hand. “You’re really horrible,” she
said. Coleman smiled at her. Still, she did not go.</p>
<p class="c010">“He who is not with me is against me,” said Coleman.
“If you can’t make up your mind to be with, it’s surely
better to be positively against than merely negatively
indifferent.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Nonsense!” exclaimed Rosie feebly.</p>
<p class="c010">“When I call my lover a nymphomaniacal dog, she runs
the pen-knife into my arm.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Well, do you enjoy it?” asked Rosie.</p>
<p class="c010">“Piercingly,” he answered. “It is at once sordid to
the last and lowest degree and infinitely and eternally
significant.”</p>
<p class="c010">Coleman was silent and Rosie too said nothing. Futilely
she wished it <em>had</em> been Toto instead of this horrible,
dangerous Cossack. Mr. Mercaptan ought to have warned
her. But then, of course, he supposed that she already
knew the creature. She looked up at him and found his
bright eyes fixed upon her; he was silently laughing.</p>
<p class="c010">“Don’t you want to know who I am?” she asked. “And
how I got here?”</p>
<p class="c010">Coleman blandly shook his head. “Not in the very
least,” he said.</p>
<p class="c010">Rosie felt more helpless, somehow, than ever. “Why
not?” she asked as bravely and impertinently as she could.</p>
<p class="c010">Coleman answered with another question. “Why
should I?”</p>
<p class="c010">“It would be natural curiosity.”</p>
<p class="c010">“But I know all I want to know,” he said. “You are a
woman, or, at any rate, you have all the female stigmata.
Not too sumptuously well-developed, let me add. You
have no wooden legs. You have eyelids that flutter up
<span class="pageno" id="Page_288">288</span>and down over your eyes like a moving shutter in front of
a signalling lamp, spelling out in a familiar code the letters:
A.M.O.R., and not, unless I am very much mistaken, those
others: C.A.S.T.I.T.A.S. You have a mouth that looks
as though it knew how to taste and how to bite. You....”</p>
<p class="c010">Rosie jumped up. “I’m going away,” she said.</p>
<p class="c010">Coleman leaned back in his chair and hallooed with
laughter. “Bite, bite, bite,” he said. “Thirty-two
times.” And he opened and shut his mouth as fast as he
could, so that his teeth clicked against one another with a
little dry, bony noise. “Every mouthful thirty-two times.
That’s what Mr. Gladstone said. And surely Mr. Gladstone”—he
rattled his sharp, white teeth again—“surely
Mr. Gladstone should know.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Good-bye,” said Rosie from the door.</p>
<p class="c010">“Good-bye,” Coleman called back; and immediately
afterwards jumped to his feet and made a dash across the
room towards her.</p>
<p class="c010">Rosie uttered a cry, slipped through the door and, slamming
it behind her, ran across the vestibule and began fumbling
with the latches of the outer door. It wouldn’t open,
it wouldn’t open. She was trembling; fear made her feel
sick. There was a rattling at the door behind her. There
was a whoop of laughter, and then the Cossack’s hands
were on her arms, his face came peering over her shoulder,
and the blond beard dabbled with blood prickled against
her neck and face.</p>
<p class="c010">“Oh, don’t, don’t, don’t!” she implored, turning
away her head. Then all at once she began violently
crying.</p>
<p class="c010">“Tears!” exclaimed Coleman in rapture, “genuine
tears!” He bent eagerly forward to kiss them away, to
<span class="pageno" id="Page_289">289</span>drink them as they fell. “What an intoxication,” he said,
looking up to the ceiling like a chicken that has taken a sip
of water; he smacked his lips.</p>
<p class="c010">Sobbing uncontrollably, Rosie had never in all her life
felt less like a great, fastidious lady.</p>

<h2 class="c008">CHAPTER XXI</h2>
</div>
<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c009">“Well,” said Gumbril, “here I am again.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Already?” Mrs. Viveash had been reduced,
by the violence of her headache, to
coming home after her luncheon with Piers Cotton for a rest.
She had fed her hungry pain on Pyramidon and now she was
lying down on the Dufy-upholstered sofa at the foot of her
full-length portrait by Jacques-Emile Blanche. Her head
was not much better, but she was bored. When the maid
had announced Gumbril, she had given word that he was to
be let in. “I’m very ill,” she went on expiringly. “Look
at me,” she pointed to herself, “and me again.” She
waved her hand towards the sizzling brilliance of the
portrait. “Before and after. Like the advertisements,
you know. Every picture tells a story.” She laughed
faintly, then made a little grimace and, sucking in the
breath between her lips, she put her hand to her forehead.</p>
<p class="c010">“My poor Myra.” Gumbril pulled up a chair to the
sofa and sat there like a doctor at his patient’s bedside.
“But before and after what?” he asked, almost professionally.</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Viveash gave an all but imperceptible shrug. “I
don’t know,” she said.</p>
<p class="c010">“Not influenza, I hope?”</p>
<p class="c010">“No, I don’t think so.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Not love, by any chance?”</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_291">291</span>Mrs. Viveash did not venture another laugh; she contented
herself with smiling agonizingly.</p>
<p class="c010">“That would have been a just retribution,” Gumbril
went on, “after what you’ve done to me.”</p>
<p class="c010">“What have I done to you?” Mrs. Viveash asked,
opening wide her pale-blue eyes.</p>
<p class="c010">“Merely wrecked my existence.”</p>
<p class="c010">“But you’re being childish, Theodore. Say what you
mean without these grand, silly phrases.” The dying voice
spoke with impatience.</p>
<p class="c010">“Well, what I mean,” said Gumbril, “is merely this.
You prevented me from going to see the only person I ever
really wanted to see in my life. And yesterday, when I
tried to see her, she was gone. Vanished. And here am I
left in the vacuum.”</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Viveash shut her eyes. “We’re all in the vacuum,”
she said. “You’ll still have plenty of company, you
know.” She was silent for a moment. “Still, I’m
sorry,” she added. “Why didn’t you tell me? And
why didn’t you just pay no attention to me and go all
the same?”</p>
<p class="c010">“I didn’t tell you,” Gumbril answered, “because, then,
I didn’t know. And I didn’t go because I didn’t want to
quarrel with you.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Thank you,” said Mrs. Viveash, and patted his hand,
“But what are you going to do about it now? Not
quarrelling with me is only a rather negative satisfaction,
I’m afraid.”</p>
<p class="c010">“I propose to leave the country to-morrow morning,”
said Gumbril.</p>
<p class="c010">“Ah, the classical remedy.... But not to shoot big
game, I hope?” She thought of Viveash among the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_292">292</span>Tikki-tikkis and the tsetses. He was a charming creature;
charming, but ... but what?</p>
<p class="c010">“Good heavens!” exclaimed Gumbril. “What do you
take me for? Big game!” He leaned back in his chair
and began to laugh, heartily, for the first time since he had
returned from Robertsbridge, yesterday evening. He had
felt then as though he would never laugh again. “Do
you see me in a pith helmet, with an elephant gun?”</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Viveash put her hand to her forehead. “I see
you, Theodore,” she said, “but I try to think you would
look quite normal; because of my head.”</p>
<p class="c010">“I go to Paris first,” said Gumbril. “After that, I
don’t know. I shall go wherever I think people will buy
pneumatic trousers. I’m travelling on business.”</p>
<p class="c010">This time, in spite of her head, Mrs. Viveash laughed.</p>
<p class="c010">“I thought of giving myself a farewell banquet,” Gumbril
went on. “We’ll go round before dinner, if you’re feeling
well enough, that is, and collect a few friends. Then, in
profoundest gloom, we’ll eat and drink. And in the morning,
unshaved, exhausted and filled with disgust, I shall
take the train from Victoria, feeling thankful to get out
of England.”</p>
<p class="c010">“We’ll do it,” said Mrs. Viveash faintly and indomitably
from the sofa that was almost genuinely a death-bed.
“And, meanwhile, we’ll have a second brew of tea and you
shall talk to me.”</p>
<p class="c010">The tannin was brought in. Gumbril settled down to
talk and Mrs. Viveash to listen—to listen and from time
to time to dab her brows with eau-de-Cologne, to take a
sniff of hartshorn.</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril talked. He talked of the marriage ceremonies
of octopuses, of the rites intricately consummated in the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_293">293</span>submarine green grottos of the Indian Ocean. Given a
total of sixteen arms, how many permutations and combinations
of caresses? And in the middle of each bunch of
arms a mouth like the beak of a macaw.</p>
<p class="c010">On the backside of the moon, his friend Umbilikoff, the
mystic, used to assure him, the souls of the dead in the form
of little bladders—like so much swelled sago—are piled
up and piled up till they squash and squeeze one another
with an excruciating and ever-growing pressure. In the
exoteric world this squeezing on the moon’s backside is
known, erroneously, as hell. And as for the constellation,
Scorpio—he was the first of all constellations to have a
proper sort of backbone. For by an effort of the will he
ingurgitated his external armour, he compressed and rebuilt
it within his body and so became the first vertebrate.
This, you may well believe, was a notable day in cosmic
history.</p>
<p class="c010">The rents in these new buildings in Regent Street and
Piccadilly run to as much as three or four pounds a square
foot. Meanwhile, all the beauty imagined by Nash has
departed, and chaos and barbarism once more reign supreme,
even in Regent Street. The ghost of Gumbril Senior
stalked across the room.</p>
<p class="c010">Who lives longer: the man who takes heroin for two
years and dies, or the man who lives on roast beef, water
and potatoes till ninety-five? One passes his twenty-four
months in eternity. All the years of the beef-eater
are lived only in time. “I can tell you all about heroin,”
said Mrs. Viveash.</p>
<p class="c010">Lady Capricorn, he understood, was still keeping open
bed. How Rubens would have admired those silk cushions,
those gigantic cabbage roses, those round pink pearls of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_294">294</span>hers, vaster than those that Captain Nemo discovered in
the immemorial oyster! And the warm dry rustle of flesh
over flesh as she walks, moving first one leg, then advancing
the other.</p>
<p class="c010">Talking of octopuses, the swim-bladders of deep-sea
fishes are filled with almost absolutely pure oxygen. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C’est
la vie</span></i>—Gumbril shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p class="c010">In Alpine pastures the grasshoppers start their flight,
whizzing like clockwork grasshoppers. And these brown
invisible ones reveal themselves suddenly as they skim above
the flowers—a streak of blue lightning, a trailing curve of
scarlet. Then the overwing shuts down over the coloured
wing below and they are once more invisible fiddlers rubbing
their thighs, like Lady Capricorn, at the foot of the towering
flowers.</p>
<p class="c010">Forgers give patina to their mediæval ivories by lending
them to stout young Jewesses to wear for a few months
hanging, like an amulet, between their breasts.</p>
<p class="c010">In Italian cemeteries the family vaults are made of glass
and iron, like greenhouses.</p>
<p class="c010">Sir Henry Griddle has finally married the hog-faced
gentlewoman.</p>
<p class="c010">Piero della Francesca’s fresco of the Resurrection at
San Sepolcro is the most beautiful picture in the world, and
the hotel there is far from bad. Scriabine = <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le</span></i> Tschaikovsky
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de nos jours</span></i>. The dullest landscape painter is Marchand.
The best poet....</p>
<p class="c010">“You bore me,” said Mrs. Viveash.</p>
<p class="c010">“Must I talk of love, then?” asked Gumbril.</p>
<p class="c010">“It looks like it,” Mrs. Viveash answered, and closed her
eyes.</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril told the anecdote about Jo Peters, Connie
<span class="pageno" id="Page_295">295</span>Asticot and Jim Baum. The anecdote of Lola Knopf
and the Baroness Gnomon. Of Margherita Radicofani,
himself, and the Pastor Meyer. Of Lord Cavey and little
Toby Nobes. When he had finished these, he saw that
Mrs. Viveash had gone to sleep.</p>
<p class="c010">He was not flattered. But a little sleep would do her
headache, he reflected, a world of good. And knowing
that if he ceased to speak, she would probably be woken
by the sudden blankness of the silence, he went on quietly
talking to himself.</p>
<p class="c010">“When I’m abroad this time,” he soliloquized, “I shall
really begin writing my autobiography. There’s nothing
like a hotel bedroom to work in.” He scratched his head
thoughtfully and even picked his nose, which was one of his
bad habits, when he was alone. “People who know me,”
he went on, “will think that what I write about the governess
cart and my mother and the flowers and so on is written
merely because I know in here,” he scratched his head a
little harder to show himself that he referred to his brain,
“that that’s the sort of thing one ought to write about.
They’ll think I’m a sort of dingy Romain Rolland, hopelessly
trying to pretend that I feel the emotions and have
the great spiritual experiences, which the really important
people do feel and have. And perhaps they’ll be right.
Perhaps the Life of Gumbril will be as manifestly an <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ersatz</span></i>
as the Life of Beethoven. On the other hand, they may
be astonished to find that it’s the genuine article. We
shall see.” Gumbril nodded his head slowly, while he
transferred two pennies from his right-hand trouser pocket
to his left-hand trouser pocket. He was somewhat distressed
to find that these coppers had been trespassing
among the silver. Silver was for the right-hand, copper
<span class="pageno" id="Page_296">296</span>for the left. It was one of the laws which it was extremely
unlucky to infringe. “I have a premonition,” he went on,
“that one of these days I may become a saint. An unsuccessful
flickering sort of saint, like a candle beginning
to go out. As for love—m’yes, m’yes. And as for the
people I have met—I shall point out that I have known
most of the eminent men in Europe, and that I have said
of all of them what I said after my first love affair: Is
that all?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Did you really say that about your first love affair?”
asked Mrs. Viveash, who had woken up again.</p>
<p class="c010">“Didn’t you?”</p>
<p class="c010">“No. I said: This <em>is</em> all—everything, the universe. In
love, it’s either all or nothing at all.” She shut her eyes
and almost immediately went to sleep again.</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril continued his lullaby-soliloquy.</p>
<p class="c010">“‘This charming little book.’... <cite>The Scotsman.</cite> ‘This
farrago of obscenity, slander and false psychology.’...
<cite>Darlington Echo.</cite> ‘Mr. Gumbril’s first cousin is St. Francis
Xavier, his second cousin is the Earl of Rochester, his third
cousin is the Man of Feeling, his fourth cousin is David
Hume.’... <cite>Court Journal.</cite>” Gumbril was already tired
of this joke. “When I consider how my light is spent,”
he went on, “when I consider!... Herr Jesu, as Fraulein
Nimmernein used to exclaim at the critical moment. Consider,
dear cow, consider. This is not the time of year for
grass to grow. Consider, dear cow, consider, consider.”
He got up from his chair and tiptoed across the room to
the writing-table. An Indian dagger lay next to the
blotting-pad; Mrs. Viveash used it as a paper-knife.
Gumbril picked it up, executed several passes with it.
“Thumb on the blade,” he said, “and strike upwards.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_297">297</span>On guard. Lunge. To the hilt it penetrates. Poniard
at the tip”—he ran the blade between his fingers—“caress
by the time it reaches the hilt. Z—zip.” He put down
the knife and stopping for a moment to make a grimace at
himself in the mirror over the mantelpiece, he went back
to his chair.</p>
<p class="c010">At seven o’clock Mrs. Viveash woke up. She shook her
head to feel if the pain were still rolling about loose inside
her skull.</p>
<p class="c010">“I really believe I’m all right,” she said. She jumped
up. “Come on,” she cried. “I feel ready for anything.”</p>
<p class="c010">“And I feel like so much food for worms,” said Gumbril.
“Still, <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Versiam’ a tazza piena il generoso umor</span></i>.” He
hummed the Drinking Song out of <cite>Robert the Devil</cite>, and to
that ingenuously jolly melody they left the house.</p>
<p class="c010">Their taxi that evening cost them several pounds. They
made the man drive back and forth, like a shuttle, from one
end of London to the other. Every time they passed
through Piccadilly Circus Mrs. Viveash leant out of the
window to look at the sky signs dancing their unceasing
St. Vitus’s dance above the monument to the Earl of
Shaftesbury.</p>
<p class="c010">“How I adore them!” she said the first time they passed
them. “Those wheels that whizz round till the sparks fly
out from under them: that rushing motor, and that
lovely bottle of port filling the glass and then disappearing
and reappearing and filling it again. Too lovely.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Too revolting,” Gumbril corrected her. “These
things are the epileptic symbol of all that’s most bestial and
idiotic in contemporary life. Look at those beastly things
and then look at that.” He pointed to the County Fire
Office on the northern side of the Circus. “There stands
<span class="pageno" id="Page_298">298</span>decency, dignity, beauty, repose. And there flickers, there
gibbers and twitches—what? Restlessness, distraction,
refusal to think, anything for an unquiet life....”</p>
<p class="c010">“What a delicious pedant you are!” She turned away
from the window, put her hands on his shoulders and looked
at him. “Too exquisitely ridiculous!” And she kissed
him.</p>
<p class="c010">“You won’t force me to change my opinion.” Gumbril
smiled at her. “<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Eppur’ si muove</span></i>—I stick to my guns like
Galileo. They move and they’re horrible.”</p>
<p class="c010">“They’re me,” said Mrs. Viveash emphatically. “Those
things are me.”</p>
<p class="c010">They drove first to Lypiatt’s mews. Under the Piranesian
arch. The clothes-lines looped from window to
window across the street might have been those ropes which
form so essential and so mysterious a part of the furniture
of the Prisons. The place smelt, the children were shouting;
the hyena-like laughter of the flappers reverberated
between the close-set walls. All Gumbril’s sense of social
responsibility was aroused in a moment.</p>
<p class="c010">Shut up in his room all day, Lypiatt had been writing—writing
his whole life, all his ideas and ideals, all for Myra.
The pile of scribbled sheets grew higher and higher.
Towards evening he made an end; he had written all that
he wanted to write. He ate the remains of yesterday’s loaf
of bread and drank some water; for he realized suddenly
that he had been fasting the whole day. Then he composed
himself to think; he stretched himself out on the brink of
the well and looked down into the eyeless darkness.</p>
<p class="c010">He still had his Service revolver. Taking it out of the
drawer in which it was kept, he loaded it, he laid it on the
packing-case which served him as a table at his bed’s head,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_299">299</span>and stretched himself out on the bed. He lay quite still,
his muscles all relaxed, hardly breathing. He imagined
himself dead. Derision! there was still the plunge into
the well.</p>
<p class="c010">He picked up the pistol, looked down the barrel. Black
and deep as the well. The muzzle against his forehead was
a cold mouth.</p>
<p class="c010">There was nothing new to be thought about death.
There was not even the possibility of a new thought. Only
the old thoughts, the horrible old questions returned.</p>
<p class="c010">The cold mouth to his forehead, his finger pressing on
the trigger. Already he would be falling, falling. And
the annihilating crash would be the same as the far-away
sound of death at the bottom of the well. And after that,
in the silence? The old question was still the same.</p>
<p class="c010">After that, he would lie bleeding. The flies would drink
his blood as though it were red honey. In the end the
people would come and fetch him away, and the coroner’s
jury would look at him in the mortuary and pronounce
him temporarily insane. Then he would be buried in a
black hole, would be buried and decay.</p>
<p class="c010">And meanwhile, would there be anything else? There
was nothing new to be thought or asked. And there was
still no answer.</p>
<p class="c010">In the room it began to grow dark; colours vanished,
forms ran together. The easel and Myra’s portrait were
now a single black silhouette against the window. Near
and far were fused, become one and continuous in the darkness,
became a part of the darkness. Outside the window
the pale twilight grew more sombre. The children shouted
shrilly, playing their games under the green gas lamps.
The mirthless, ferocious laughter of young girls mocked
<span class="pageno" id="Page_300">300</span>and invited. Lypiatt stretched out his hand and fingered
the pistol.</p>
<p class="c010">Down below, at his door, he heard a sharp knocking. He
lifted his head and listened, caught the sound of two voices,
a man’s and a woman’s. Myra’s voice he recognized at
once; the other, he supposed, was Gumbril’s.</p>
<p class="c010">“Hideous to think that people actually live in places
like this,” Gumbril was saying. “Look at those children.
It ought to be punishable by law to produce children in
this street.”</p>
<p class="c010">“They always take me for the Pied Piper,” said Mrs.
Viveash. Lypiatt got up and crept to the window. He
could hear all they said.</p>
<p class="c010">“I wonder if Lypiatt’s in. I don’t see any sign of a
light.”</p>
<p class="c010">“But he has heavy curtains,” said Mrs. Viveash, “and I
know for a fact that he always composes his poetry in the
dark. He may be composing poetry.”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril laughed.</p>
<p class="c010">“Knock again,” said Mrs. Viveash. “Poets are always
absorbed, you know. And Casimir’s always the poet.”</p>
<p class="c010">“<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Il Poeta</span></i>—capital P. Like d’Annunzio in the Italian
papers,” said Gumbril. “Did you know that d’Annunzio
has books printed on mackintosh for his bath?” He rapped
again at the door. “I saw it in the <cite>Corriere della Sera</cite> the
other day at the club. He reads the <cite>Little Flowers of St.
Francis</cite> by preference in his bath. And he has a fountain
pen with waterproof ink in the soap-dish, so that he can add
a few Fioretti of his own whenever he feels like it. We
might suggest that to Casimir.”</p>
<p class="c010">Lypiatt stood with folded arms by the window, listening.
How lightly they threw his life, his heart, from hand to
<span class="pageno" id="Page_301">301</span>hand, as though it were a ball and they were playing a
game! He thought suddenly of all the times he had spoken
lightly and maliciously of other people. His own person
had always seemed, on those occasions, sacred. One knew
in theory very well that others spoke of one contemptuously—as
one spoke of them. In practice—it was hard to believe.</p>
<p class="c010">“Poor Casimir!” said Mrs. Viveash. “I’m afraid his
show was a failure.”</p>
<p class="c010">“I know it was,” said Gumbril. “Complete and
absolute. I told my tame capitalist that he ought to
employ Lypiatt for our advertisements. He’d be excellent
for those. And it would mean some genuine money
in his pocket.”</p>
<p class="c010">“But the worst of it is,” said Mrs. Viveash, “that he’ll
only feel insulted by the suggestion.” She looked up at the
window.</p>
<p class="c010">“I don’t know why,” she went on, “this house looks
most horribly dead. I hope nothing’s happened to poor
Casimir. I have a most disagreeable feeling that it may
have.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Ah, this famous feminine intuition,” laughed Gumbril.
He knocked again.</p>
<p class="c010">“I can’t help feeling that he may be lying there dead,
or delirious, or something.”</p>
<p class="c010">“And I can’t help feeling that he must have gone out to
dinner. We shall have to give him up, I’m afraid. It’s
a pity. He’s so good with Mercaptan. Like bear and
mastiff. Or rather, like bear and poodle, bear and King
Charles’s spaniel—or whatever those little dogs are that you
see ladies in eighteenth-century French engravings taking
to bed with them. Let’s go.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Just knock once again,” said Mrs. Viveash. “He might
<span class="pageno" id="Page_302">302</span>really be preoccupied, or asleep, or ill.” Gumbril knocked.
“Now listen. Hush.”</p>
<p class="c010">They were silent; the children still went on hallooing
in the distance. There was a great clop-clopping of horse’s
feet as a van was backed into a stable door near by. Lypiatt
stood motionless, his arms still crossed, his chin on his
breast. The seconds passed.</p>
<p class="c010">“Not a sound,” said Gumbril. “He must have gone
out.”</p>
<p class="c010">“I suppose so,” said Mrs. Viveash.</p>
<p class="c010">“Come on, then. We’ll go and look for Mercaptan.”</p>
<p class="c010">He heard their steps in the street below, heard the slamming
of the taxi door. The engine was started up. Loud
on the first gear, less loud on the second, whisperingly on the
third, it moved away, gathering speed. The noise of it was
merged with the general noise of the town. They were
gone.</p>
<p class="c010">Lypiatt walked slowly back to his bed. He wished
suddenly that he had gone down to answer the last knock.
These voices—at the well’s edge he had turned to listen to
them; at the well’s extreme verge. He lay quite still in
the darkness; and it seemed to him at last that he had
floated away from the earth, that he was alone, no longer
in a narrow dark room, but in an illimitable darkness outside
and beyond. His mind grew calmer; he began to think of
himself, of all that he had known, remotely, as though
from a great way off.</p>
<p class="c010">“Adorable lights!” said Mrs. Viveash, as they drove
once more through Piccadilly Circus.</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril said nothing. He had said all that he had to
say last time.</p>
<p class="c010">“And there’s another,” exclaimed Mrs. Viveash, as
<span class="pageno" id="Page_303">303</span>they passed, near Burlington House, a fountain of Sandeman’s
port. “If only they had an automatic jazz band
attached to the same mechanism!” she said regretfully.</p>
<p class="c010">The Green Park remained solitary and remote under the
moon. “Wasted on us,” said Gumbril, as they passed.
“One should be happily in love to enjoy a summer night
under the trees.” He wondered where Emily could be
now. They sat in silence; the cab drove on.</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Mercaptan, it seemed, had left London. His housekeeper
had a long story to tell. A regular Bolshevik had
come yesterday, pushing in. And she had heard him
shouting at Mr. Mercaptan in his own room. And then,
luckily, a lady had come and the Bolshevik had gone away
again. And this morning Mr. Mercaptan had decided,
quite sudden like, to go away for two or three days. And it
wouldn’t surprise her at all if it had something to do with
that horrible Bolshevik fellow. Though of course Master
Paster hadn’t said anything about it. Still, as she’d known
him when he was so high and seen him grow up like, she
thought she could say she knew him well enough to guess
why he did things. It was only brutally that they contrived
to tear themselves away.</p>
<p class="c010">Secure, meanwhile, behind a whole troop of butlers and
footmen, Mr. Mercaptan was dining comfortably at Oxhanger
with the most faithful of his friends and admirers,
Mrs. Speegle. It was to Mrs. Speegle that he had dedicated
his coruscating little ‘Loves of the Pachyderms’; for Mrs.
Speegle it was who had suggested, casually one day at
luncheon, that the human race ought to be classified in two
main species—the Pachyderms, and those whose skin, like
her own, like Mr. Mercaptan’s and a few others’, was fine
and ‘responsive,’ as Mr. Mercaptan himself put it, ‘to all
<span class="pageno" id="Page_304">304</span>caresses, including those of pure reason.’ Mr. Mercaptan
had taken the casual hint and had developed it, richly. The
barbarous Pachyderms he divided up into a number of subspecies:
steatocephali, acephali, theolaters, industrious
Judæorhynci—busy, compact and hard as dung-beetles—Peabodies,
Russians and so on. It was all very witty and
delicately savage. Mr. Mercaptan had a standing invitation
at Oxhanger. With dangerous pachyderms like Lypiatt
ranging loose about the town, he thought it best to avail
himself of it. Mrs. Speegle, he knew, would be delighted
to see him. And indeed she was. He arrived just at lunch-time.
Mrs. Speegle and Maisie Furlonger were already at
the fish.</p>
<p class="c010">“Mercaptan!” Mrs. Speegle’s soul seemed to be in the
name. “Sit down,” she went on, cooing as she talked,
like a ring-dove. There seemed to be singing in every
word she spoke. She pointed to a chair next to hers.
“N’you’re n’just in time to tell us all about <em>n’your</em>
Lesbian experiences.”</p>
<p class="c010">And Mercaptan, giving vent to his fully orchestrated
laugh—squeal and roar together—had sat down and, speaking
in French partly, he nodded towards the butler and the
footman, ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à cause des valets</span></i>,’ and partly because the language
lent itself more deliciously to this kind of confidences, he
had begun there and then, interrupted and spurred on by
the cooing of Mrs. Speegle and the happy shrieks of Maisie
Furlonger, to recount at length and with all the wit in the
world his experience among the Isles of Greece. How
delicious it was, he said to himself, to be with really civilized
people! In this happy house it seemed scarcely possible
to believe that such a thing as a pachyderm existed.</p>
<p class="c010">But Lypiatt still lay, face upwards, on his bed, floating,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_305">305</span>it seemed to himself, far out into the dark emptinesses
between the stars. From those distant abstract spaces he
seemed to be looking impersonally down upon his own body
stretched out by the brink of the hideous well; to be
looking back over his own history. Everything, even his
own unhappiness, seemed very small and beautiful; every
frightful convulsion had become no more than a ripple, and
only the fine musical ghost of sound came up to him from
all the shouting.</p>
<p class="c010">“We have no luck,” said Gumbril, as they climbed once
more into the cab.</p>
<p class="c010">“I’m not sure,” said Mrs. Viveash, “that we haven’t
really had a great deal. Did you genuinely want very much
to see Mercaptan?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Not in the least,” said Gumbril. “But do you genuinely
want to see me?”</p>
<p class="c010">Mrs. Viveash drew the corners of her mouth down into
a painful smile and did not answer. “Aren’t we going to
pass through Piccadilly Circus again?” she asked. “I
should like to see the lights again. They give one temporarily
the illusion of being cheerful.”</p>
<p class="c010">“No, no,” said Gumbril, “we are going straight to
Victoria.”</p>
<p class="c010">“We couldn’t tell the driver to...?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Certainly not.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Ah, well,” said Mrs. Viveash. “Perhaps one’s better
without stimulants. I remember when I was very young,
when I first began to go about at all, how proud I was of
having discovered champagne. It seemed to me wonderful
to get rather tipsy. Something to be exceedingly proud of.
And, at the same time, how much I really disliked wine!
Loathed the taste of it. Sometimes, when Calliope and I
<span class="pageno" id="Page_306">306</span>used to dine quietly together, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</span></i>, with no awful
men about, and no appearances to keep up, we used to treat
ourselves to the luxury of a large lemon-squash, or even
raspberry syrup and soda. Ah, I wish I could recapture
the deliciousness of raspberry syrup.”</p>
<p class="c010">Coleman was at home. After a brief delay he appeared
himself at the door. He was wearing pyjamas, and his face
was covered with red-brown smears, the tips of his beard
were clotted with the same dried pigment.</p>
<p class="c010">“What have you been doing to yourself?” asked Mrs.
Viveash.</p>
<p class="c010">“Merely washing in the blood of the Lamb,” Coleman
answered, smiling, and his eyes sparkling blue fire, like an
electric machine.</p>
<p class="c010">The door on the opposite side of the little vestibule was
open. Looking over Coleman’s shoulder, Gumbril could
see through the opening a brightly lighted room and, in
the middle of it, like a large rectangular island, a wide divan.
Reclining on the divan an odalisque by Ingres—but slimmer,
more serpentine, more like a lithe pink length of boa—presented
her back. That big, brown mole on the right
shoulder was surely familiar. But when, startled by the
loudness of the voices behind her, the odalisque turned
round—to see in a horribly embarrassing instant that the
Cossack had left the door open and that people could look
in, were looking in, indeed—the slanting eyes beneath their
heavy white lids, the fine aquiline nose, the wide, full-lipped
mouth, though they presented themselves for only
the fraction of a second, were still more recognizable and
familiar. For only the fraction of a second did the odalisque
reveal herself definitely as Rosie. Then a hand pulled
feverishly at the counterpane, the section of buff-coloured
<span class="pageno" id="Page_307">307</span>boa wriggled and rolled; and, in a moment, where an
odalisque had been, lay only a long packet under a white
sheet, like a jockey with a fractured skull when they carry
him from the course.</p>
<p class="c010">Well, really.... Gumbril felt positively indignant;
not jealous, but astonished and righteously indignant.</p>
<p class="c010">“Well, when you’ve finished bathing,” said Mrs. Viveash,
“I hope you’ll come and have dinner with us.” Coleman
was standing between her and the farther door; Mrs.
Viveash had seen nothing in the room beyond the vestibule.</p>
<p class="c010">“I’m busy,” said Coleman.</p>
<p class="c010">“So I see.” Gumbril spoke as sarcastically as he could.</p>
<p class="c010">“Do you see?” asked Coleman, and looked round.
“So you do!” He stepped back and closed the door.</p>
<p class="c010">“It’s Theodore’s last dinner,” pleaded Mrs. Viveash.</p>
<p class="c010">“Not even if it were his last supper,” said Coleman,
enchanted to have been given the opportunity to blaspheme
a little. “Is he going to be crucified? Or what?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Merely going abroad,” said Gumbril.</p>
<p class="c010">“He has a broken heart,” Mrs. Viveash explained.</p>
<p class="c010">“Ah, the genuine platonic towsers?” Coleman uttered
his artificial demon’s laugh.</p>
<p class="c010">“That’s just about it,” said Gumbril, grimly.</p>
<p class="c010">Relieved by the shutting of the door from her immediate
embarrassment, Rosie threw back a corner of the
counterpane and extruded her head, one arm and the
shoulder with the mole on it. She looked about her,
opening her slanting eyes as wide as she could. She
listened with parted lips to the voices that came, muffled
now, through the door. It seemed to her as though she
were waking up; as though now, for the first time, she were
hearing that shattering laugh, were looking now for the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_308">308</span>first time on these blank, white walls and the one lovely and
horrifying picture. Where was she? What did it all
mean? Rosie put her hand to her forehead, tried to think.
Her thinking was always a series of pictures; one after
another the pictures swam up before her eyes, melted again
in an instant.</p>
<p class="c010">Her mother taking off her pince-nez to wipe them—and
at once her eyes were tremulous and vague and helpless.
“You should always let the gentleman get over the stile
first,” she said, and put on her glasses again. Behind the
glasses her eyes immediately became clear, piercing, steady
and efficient. Rather formidable eyes. They had seen
Rosie getting over the stile in front of Willie Hoskyns,
and there was too much leg.</p>
<p class="c010">James reading at his desk; his heavy, round head propped
on his hand. She came up behind him and threw her arms
round his neck. Very gently, and without turning his
eyes from the page, he undid her embrace and, with a little
push that was no more than a hint, an implication, signified
that he didn’t want her. She had gone to her pink room,
and cried.</p>
<p class="c010">Another time James shook his head and smiled patiently
under his moustache. ‘You’ll never learn,’ he said. She
had gone to her room and cried that time too.</p>
<p class="c010">Another time they were lying in bed together, in the pink
bed; only you couldn’t see it was pink because there was
no light. They were lying very quietly. Warm and happy
and remote she felt. Sometimes as it were the physical
memory of pleasure plucked at her nerves, making her
start, making her suddenly shiver. James was breathing
as though he were asleep. All at once he stirred. He
patted her shoulder two or three times in a kindly and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_309">309</span>business-like way. “I know what that means,” she said,
“when you pat me like that.” And she patted him—pat-pat-pat,
very quickly. “It means you’re going to
bed.” “How do you know?” he asked. “Do you think
I don’t know you after all this time? I know that pat
by heart.” And suddenly all her warm, quiet happiness
evaporated; it was all gone. “I’m only a machine
for going to bed with,” she said. “That’s all I am for
you.” She felt she would like to cry. But James only
laughed and said, “Nonsense!” and pulled his arm clumsily
from underneath her. “You go to sleep,” he said, and
kissed her on the forehead. Then he got out of bed, and
she heard him bumping clumsily about in the darkness.
“Damn!” he said once. Then he found the door, opened,
and was gone.</p>
<p class="c010">She thought of those long stories she used to make up
when she went shopping. The fastidious lady; the poets;
all the adventures.</p>
<p class="c010">Toto’s hands were wonderful.</p>
<p class="c010">She saw, she heard Mr. Mercaptan reading his essay.
Poor father, reading aloud from the <cite>Hibbert Journal</cite>!</p>
<p class="c010">And now the Cossack, covered with blood. He, too,
might read aloud from the <cite>Hibbert Journal</cite>—only backwards,
so to speak. She had a bruise on her arm. “You
think there’s nothing inherently wrong and disgusting in
it?” he had asked. “There is, I tell you.” He had
laughed and kissed her and stripped off her clothes and
caressed her. And she had cried, she had struggled, she
had tried to turn away; and in the end she had been overcome
by a pleasure more piercing and agonizing than anything
she had ever felt before. And all the time Coleman
had hung over her, with his blood-stained beard, smiling
<span class="pageno" id="Page_310">310</span>into her face, and whispering, “Horrible, horrible, infamous
and shameful.” She lay in a kind of stupor. Then,
suddenly there had been that ringing. The Cossack had
left her. And now she was awake again, and it was horrible,
it was shameful. She shuddered; she jumped out of bed
and began as quickly as she could to put on her clothes.</p>
<p class="c010">“Really, really, won’t you come?” Mrs. Viveash was
insisting. She was not used to people saying no when she
asked, when she insisted. She didn’t like it.</p>
<p class="c010">“No.” Coleman shook his head. “You may be having
the last supper. But I have a date here with the Magdalen.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Oh, a woman,” said Viveash. “But why didn’t you
say so before?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Well, as I’d left the door open,” said Coleman, “I
thought it was unnecessary.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Fie,” said Mrs. Viveash. “I find this very repulsive.
Let’s go away.” She plucked Gumbril by the sleeve.</p>
<p class="c010">“Good-bye,” said Coleman, politely. He shut the
door after them and turned back across the little hall.</p>
<p class="c010">“What! Not thinking of going?” he exclaimed, as he
came in. Rosie was sitting down on the edge of the bed
pulling on her shoes.</p>
<p class="c010">“Go away,” she said. “You disgust me.”</p>
<p class="c010">“But that’s splendid,” Coleman declared. “That’s
all as it should be, all as I intended.” He sat down beside
her on the divan. “Really,” he said, admiringly, “what
exquisite legs!”</p>
<p class="c010">Rosie would have given anything in the world to be back
again in Bloxam Gardens. Even if James did live in his
books all the time.... Anything in the world.</p>
<p class="c010">“This time,” said Mrs. Viveash, “we simply must go
through Piccadilly Circus.”</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_311">311</span>“It’ll only be about two miles farther.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Well, that isn’t much.”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril leaned out and gave the word to the driver.</p>
<p class="c010">“And besides, I like driving about like this,” said Mrs.
Viveash. “I like driving for driving’s sake. It’s like the
Last Ride Together. Dear Theodore!” She laid her
hand on his.</p>
<p class="c010">“Thank you,” said Gumbril, and kissed it.</p>
<p class="c010">The little cab buzzed along down the empty Mall. They
were silent. Through the thick air one could see the
brightest of the stars. It was one of those evenings when
men feel that truth, goodness and beauty are one. In the
morning, when they commit their discovery to paper, when
others read it written there, it looks wholly ridiculous. It
was one of those evenings when love is once more invented
for the first time. That, too, seems a little ridiculous, sometimes,
in the morning.</p>
<p class="c010">“Here are the lights again,” said Mrs. Viveash. “Hop,
twitch, flick—yes, genuinely an illusion of jollity, Theodore.
Genuinely.”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril stopped the cab. “It’s after half-past eight,”
he said. “At this rate we shall never get anything to eat.
Wait a minute.”</p>
<p class="c010">He ran into Appenrodt’s, and came back in a moment
with a packet of smoked salmon sandwiches, a bottle of
white wine and a glass.</p>
<p class="c010">“We have a long way to go,” he explained, as he got
into the taxi.</p>
<p class="c010">They ate their sandwiches, they drank their wine. The
taxi drove on and on.</p>
<p class="c010">“This is positively exhilarating,” said Mrs. Viveash, as
they turned into the Edgware Road.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_312">312</span>Polished by the wheels and shining like an old and precious
bronze, the road stretched before them, reflecting the
lamps. It had the inviting air of a road which goes on
for ever.</p>
<p class="c010">“They used to have such good peep-shows in this street,”
Gumbril tenderly remembered: “Little back shops where
you paid twopence to see the genuine mermaid, which
turned out to be a stuffed walrus, and the tattooed lady,
and the dwarf, and the living statuary, which one always
hoped, as a boy, was really going to be rather naked and
thrilling, but which was always the most pathetic of unemployed
barmaids, dressed in the thickest of pink Jaeger.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Do you think there’d be any of those now?” asked Mrs.
Viveash.</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril shook his head. “They’ve moved on with the
march of civilization. But where?” He spread out his
hands interrogatively. “I don’t know which direction
civilization marches—whether north towards Kilburn and
Golders Green, or over the river to the Elephant, to Clapham
and Sydenham and all those other mysterious places. But,
in any case, high rents have marched up here; there are
no more genuine mermaids in the Edgware Road. What
stories we shall be able to tell our children!”</p>
<p class="c010">“Do you think we shall ever have any?” Mrs. Viveash
asked.</p>
<p class="c010">“One can never tell.”</p>
<p class="c010">“I should have thought one could,” said Mrs. Viveash.
Children—that would be the most desperate experiment of
all. The most desperate, and perhaps the only one having
any chance of being successful. History recorded cases....
On the other hand, it recorded other cases that proved the
opposite. She had often thought of this experiment.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_313">313</span>There were so many obvious reasons for not making it.
But some day, perhaps—she always put it off, like that.</p>
<p class="c010">The cab had turned off the main road into quieter and
darker streets.</p>
<p class="c010">“Where are we now?” asked Mrs. Viveash.</p>
<p class="c010">“Penetrating into Maida Vale. We shall soon be there.
Poor old Shearwater!” He laughed. Other people in
love were always absurd.</p>
<p class="c010">“Shall we find him in, I wonder?” It would be fun
to see Shearwater again. She liked to hear him talking,
learnedly, and like a child. But when the child is six feet
high and three feet wide and two feet thick, when it tries
to plunge head first into your life—then, really, no....
“But what did you want with me?” he had asked. “Just
to look at you,” she answered. Just to look; that was all.
Music hall, not boudoir.</p>
<p class="c010">“Here we are.” Gumbril got out and rang the second
floor bell.</p>
<p class="c010">The door was opened by an impertinent-looking little
maid.</p>
<p class="c010">“Mr. Shearwater’s at the lavatory,” she said, in answer
to Gumbril’s question.</p>
<p class="c010">“Laboratory?” he suggested.</p>
<p class="c010">“At the ’ospital.” That made it clear.</p>
<p class="c010">“And is Mrs. Shearwater at home?” he asked maliciously.</p>
<p class="c010">The little maid shook her head. “I expected ’er, but
she didn’t come back to dinner.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Would you mind giving her a message when she does
come in,” said Gumbril. “Tell her that Mr. Toto was
very sorry he hadn’t time to speak to her when he saw her
this evening in Pimlico.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Mr. who?”</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_314">314</span>“Mr. Toto.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Mr. Toto is sorry ’e ’adn’t the time to speak to Mrs.
Shearwater when ’e saw ’er in Pimlico this evening. Very
well, sir.”</p>
<p class="c010">“You won’t forget?” said Gumbril.</p>
<p class="c010">“No, I won’t forget.”</p>
<p class="c010">He went back to the cab and explained that they had
drawn blank once more.</p>
<p class="c010">“I’m rather glad,” said Mrs. Viveash. “If we ever did
find anybody, it would mean the end of this Last-Ride-Together
feeling. And that would be sad. And it’s a
lovely night. And really, for the moment, I feel I can do
without my lights. Suppose we just drove for a bit now.”</p>
<p class="c010">But Gumbril would not allow that. “We haven’t had
enough to eat yet,” he said, and he gave the cabman Gumbril
Senior’s address.</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril Senior was sitting on his little iron balcony among
the dried-out pots that had once held geraniums, smoking
his pipe and looking earnestly out into the darkness in front
of him. Clustered in the fourteen plane trees of the square,
the starlings were already asleep. There was no sound
but the rustling of the leaves. But sometimes, every hour
or so, the birds would wake up. Something—perhaps it
might be a stronger gust of wind, perhaps some happy
dream of worms, some nightmare of cats simultaneously
dreamed by all the flock together—would suddenly rouse
them. And then they would all start to talk at once, at
the tops of their shrill voices—for perhaps half a minute.
Then in an instant they all went to sleep again and there
was once more no sound but the rustling of the shaken
leaves. At these moments Mr. Gumbril would lean forward,
would strain his eyes and his ears in the hope of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_315">315</span>seeing, of hearing something—something significant, explanatory,
satisfying. He never did, of course; but that
in no way diminished his happiness.</p>
<p class="c010">Mr. Gumbril received them on his balcony with courtesy.</p>
<p class="c010">“I was just thinking of going in to work,” he said. “And
now you come and give me a good excuse for sitting out
here a little longer. I’m delighted.”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril Junior went downstairs to see what he could
find in the way of food. While he was gone, his father
explained to Mrs. Viveash the secrets of the birds. Enthusiastically,
his light floss of grey hair floating up and
falling again about his head as he pointed and gesticulated,
he told her; the great flocks assembled—goodness only
knew where!—they flew across the golden sky, detaching
here a little troop, there a whole legion, they flew until at
last all had found their appointed resting-places and there
were no more to fly. He made this nightly flight sound
epical, as though it were a migration of peoples, a passage
of armies.</p>
<p class="c010">“And it’s my firm belief,” said Gumbril Senior, adding
notes to his epic, “that they make use of some sort of telepathy,
some kind of direct mind-to-mind communication
between themselves. You can’t watch them without
coming to that conclusion.”</p>
<p class="c010">“A charming conclusion,” said Mrs. Viveash.</p>
<p class="c010">“It’s a faculty,” Gumbril Senior went on, “we all
possess, I believe. All we animals.” He made a gesture
which included himself, Mrs. Viveash and the invisible
birds among the plane trees. “Why don’t we use it more?
You may well ask. For the simple reason, my dear young
lady, that half our existence is spent in dealing with things
that have no mind—things with which it is impossible to
<span class="pageno" id="Page_316">316</span>hold telepathic communication. Hence the development
of the five senses. I have eyes that preserve me from
running into the lamp-post, ears that warn me I’m in the
neighbourhood of Niagara. And having made these instruments
very efficient, I use them even in holding converse
with other beings having a mind. I let my telepathic
faculty lie idle, preferring to employ an elaborate and
cumbrous arrangement of symbols in order to make my
thought known to you through your senses. In certain
individuals, however, the faculty is naturally so well-developed—like
the musical, or the mathematical, or the
chess-playing faculties in other people—that they cannot
help entering into direct communication with other minds,
whether they want to or not. If we knew a good method
of educating and drawing out the latent faculty, most of us
could make ourselves moderately efficient telepaths; just
as most of us can make ourselves into moderate musicians,
chess players and mathematicians. There would also be a
few, no doubt, who could never communicate directly.
Just as there are a few who cannot recognize ‘Rule
Britannia’ or Bach’s Concerto in D minor for two violins,
and a few who cannot comprehend the nature of an
algebraical symbol. Look at the general development of
the mathematical and musical faculties only within the last
two hundred years. By the twenty-first century, I believe,
we shall all be telepaths. Meanwhile, these delightful
birds have forestalled us. Not having the wit to invent a
language or an expressive pantomime, they contrive to
communicate such simple thoughts as they have, directly
and instantaneously. They all go to sleep at once, wake
at once, say the same thing at once; they turn all at once
when they’re flying. Without a leader, without a word of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_317">317</span>command, they do everything together, in complete unison.
Sitting here in the evenings, I sometimes fancy I can feel
their thoughts striking against my own. It has happened
to me once or twice: that I have known a second before
it actually happened, that the birds were going to wake up
and begin their half-minute of chatter in the dark. Wait!
Hush.” Gumbril Senior threw back his head, pressed his
hand over his mouth, as though by commanding silence
on himself he could command it on the whole world. “I
believe they’re going to wake now. I feel it.”</p>
<p class="c010">He was silent. Mrs. Viveash looked towards the dark
trees and listened. A full minute passed. Then the old
gentleman burst out happily laughing.</p>
<p class="c010">“Completely wrong!” he said. “They’ve never been
more soundly asleep.” Mrs. Viveash laughed too. “Perhaps
they all changed their minds, just as they were waking
up,” she suggested.</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril Junior reappeared; glasses clinked as he walked,
and there was a little rattle of crockery. He was carrying
a tray.</p>
<p class="c010">“Cold beef,” he said, “and salad and a bit of a cold
apple-pie. It might be worse.”</p>
<p class="c010">They drew up chairs to Gumbril Senior’s work-table,
and there, among the letters and the unpaid bills and the
sketchy elevations of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">archiducal</span> palaces, they ate the beef
and the apple-pie, and drank the one-and-ninepenny <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin
ordinaire</span></i> of the house. Gumbril Senior, who had already
supped, looked on at them from the balcony.</p>
<p class="c010">“Did I tell you,” said Gumbril Junior, “that we saw
Mr. Porteous’s son the other evening—very drunk?”</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril Senior threw up his hands. “If you knew the
calamities that young imbecile has been the cause of!”</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_318">318</span>“What’s he done?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Gambled away I don’t know how much borrowed
money. And poor Porteous can’t afford anything—even
now.” Mr. Gumbril shook his head and clutched and
combed his beard. “It’s a fearful blow, but of course,
Porteous is very steadfast and serene and.... There!”
Gumbril Senior interrupted himself, holding up his hand.
“Listen!”</p>
<p class="c010">In the fourteen plane trees the starlings had suddenly
woken up.</p>
<p class="c010">There was a wild outburst, like a stormy sitting in the
Italian Parliament. Then all was silent. Gumbril Senior
listened, enchanted. His face, as he turned back towards
the light, revealed itself all smiles. His hair seemed to have
blown loose of its own accord, from within, so to speak;
he pushed it into place.</p>
<p class="c010">“You heard them?” he asked Mrs. Viveash. “What
can they have to say to one another, I wonder, at this time
of night?”</p>
<p class="c010">“And did you feel they were going to wake up?” Mrs.
Viveash inquired.</p>
<p class="c010">“No,” said Gumbril Senior with candour.</p>
<p class="c010">“When we’ve finished,” Gumbril Junior spoke with his
mouth full, “you must show Myra your model of London.
She’d adore it—except that it has no electric sky-signs.”</p>
<p class="c010">His father looked all of a sudden very much embarrassed.
“I don’t think it would interest Mrs. Viveash much,” he
said.</p>
<p class="c010">“Oh, yes it would. Really,” she declared.</p>
<p class="c010">“Well, as a matter of fact it isn’t here.” Gumbril
Senior pulled with fury at his beard.</p>
<p class="c010">“Not here? But what’s happened to it?”</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_319">319</span>Gumbril Senior wouldn’t explain. He just ignored his
son’s question and began to talk once more about the
starlings. Later on, however, when Gumbril and Mrs.
Viveash were preparing to go, the old man drew him apart
into a corner and began to whisper the explanation.</p>
<p class="c010">“I didn’t want to blare it about in front of strangers,”
he said, as though it were a question of the housemaid’s
illegitimate baby or a repair to the water-closet. “But the
fact is, I’ve sold it. The Victoria and Albert had wind
that I was making it; they’ve been wanting it all the time.
And I’ve let them have it.”</p>
<p class="c010">“But why?” Gumbril Junior asked in a tone of astonishment.
He knew with what a paternal affection—no, more
than paternal; for he was sure that his father was more
whole-heartedly attached to his models than his son—with
what pride he regarded these children of his spirit.</p>
<p class="c010">Gumbril Senior sighed. “It’s all that young imbecile,”
he said.</p>
<p class="c010">“What young imbecile?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Porteous’s son, of course. You see, poor Porteous has
had to sell his library, among other things. You don’t
know what that means to him. All these precious books.
And collected at the price of such hardships. I thought
I’d like to buy a few of the best ones back for him. They
gave me quite a good price at the Museum.” He came
out of his corner and hurried across the room to help Mrs.
Viveash with her cloak. “Allow me, allow me,” he said.</p>
<p class="c010">Slowly and pensively Gumbril Junior followed him.
Beyond good and evil? Below good and evil? The name
of earwig.... The tubby pony trotted. The wild columbines
suspended, among the shadows of the hazel copse,
hooked spurs, helmets of aerial purple. The twelfth sonata
<span class="pageno" id="Page_320">320</span>of Mozart was insecticide; no earwigs could crawl through
that music. Emily’s breasts were firm and pointed and she
had slept at last without a tremor. In the starlight, good,
true and beautiful became one. Write the discovery in
books—in books <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quos</span></i>, in the morning, <em>legimus cacantes</em>.
They descended the stairs. The cab was waiting outside.</p>
<p class="c010">“The Last Ride again,” said Mrs. Viveash.</p>
<p class="c010">“Golgotha Hospital, Southwark,” said Gumbril to the
driver and followed her into the cab.</p>
<p class="c010">“Drive, drive, drive,” repeated Mrs. Viveash. “I like
your father, Theodore. One of these days he’ll fly away
with the birds. And how nice it is of those starlings to
wake themselves up like that in the middle of the night,
merely to amuse him. Considering how unpleasant it is
to be woken in the night. Where are we going?”</p>
<p class="c010">“We’re going to look at Shearwater in his laboratory.”</p>
<p class="c010">“Is that a long way away?”</p>
<p class="c010">“Immensely,” said Gumbril.</p>
<p class="c010">“Thank God for that,” Mrs. Viveash piously and expiringly
breathed.</p>
<div class="chapter">
<span class="pageno" id="Page_321">321</span>
<h2 class="c008">CHAPTER XXII</h2>
</div>
<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c009">Shearwater sat on his stationary bicycle, pedalling
unceasingly like a man in a nightmare. The
pedals were geared to a little wheel under the
saddle and the rim of the wheel rubbed, as it revolved
against a brake, carefully adjusted to make the work of the
pedaller hard, but not impossibly hard. From a pipe
which came up through the floor issued a little jet of water
which played on the brake and kept it cool. But no jet of
water played on Shearwater. It was his business to get hot.
He did get hot.</p>
<p class="c010">From time to time his dog-faced young friend, Lancing,
came and looked through the window of the experimenting
chamber to see how he was getting on. Inside that little
wooden house, which might have reminded Lancing, if he
had had a literary turn of mind, of the Box in which Gulliver
left Brobdingnag, the scenes of intimate life were the same
every time he looked in. Shearwater was always at his
post on the saddle of the nightmare bicycle, pedalling,
pedalling. The water trickled over the brake. And Shearwater
sweated. Great drops of sweat came oozing out
from under his hair, ran down over his forehead, hung
beaded on his eyebrows, ran into his eyes, down his nose,
along his cheeks, fell like raindrops. His thick bull-neck
was wet; his whole naked body, his arms and legs streamed
and shone. The sweat poured off him and was caught as
it rained down in a waterproof sheet, to trickle down its
<span class="pageno" id="Page_322">322</span>sloping folds into a large glass receptacle which stood under
a hole in the centre of the sheet at the focal point where
all its slopes converged. The automatically controlled heating
apparatus in the basement kept the temperature in the box
high and steady. Peering through the damp-dimmed
panes of the window. Lancing noticed with satisfaction
that the mercury stood unchangingly at twenty-seven point
five Centigrade. The ventilators at the side and top of the
box were open; Shearwater had air enough. Another
time, Lancing reflected, they’d make the box air-tight and
see the effect of a little carbon dioxide poisoning on top
of excessive sweating. It might be very interesting, but
to-day they were concerned with sweating only. After
seeing that the thermometer was steady, that the ventilators
were properly open, the water was still trickling over the
brake, Lancing would tap at the window. And Shearwater,
who kept his eyes fixed straight before him, as he pedalled
slowly and unremittingly along his nightmare road, would
turn his head at the sound.</p>
<p class="c010">“All right?” Lancing’s lips moved and his eyebrows
went up inquiringly.</p>
<p class="c010">Shearwater would nod his big, round head, and the sweatdrops,
suspended on his eyebrows and his moustache, would
fall like little liquid fruits shaken suddenly by the wind.</p>
<p class="c010">“Good,” and Lancing would go back to his thick German
book under the reading-lamp at the other end of the
laboratory.</p>
<p class="c010">Constant as the thermometer Shearwater pedalled
steadily and slowly on. With a few brief halts for food
and rest, he had been pedalling ever since lunch-time. At
eleven he would go to bed on a shake-down in the laboratory
and at nine to-morrow morning he would re-enter the box
<span class="pageno" id="Page_323">323</span>and start pedalling again. He would go on all to-morrow
and the day after; and after that, as long as he could stand
it. One, two, three, four. Pedal, pedal, pedal.... He
must have travelled the equivalent of sixty or seventy miles
this afternoon. He would be getting on for Swindon.
He would be nearly at Portsmouth. He would be past
Cambridge, past Oxford. He would be nearly at Harwich,
pedalling through the green and golden valleys where
Constable used to paint. He would be at Winchester by
the bright stream. He would have ridden through the
beech woods of Arundel out into the sea....</p>
<p class="c010">In any case he was far away, he was escaping. And Mrs.
Viveash followed, walking swayingly along on feet that
seemed to tread between two abysses, at her leisure. Pedal,
pedal. The hydrogen ion concentration in the blood....
Formidably, calmly, her eyes regarded. The lids cut off
an arc of those pale circles. When she smiled, it was a
crucifixion. The coils of her hair were copper serpents.
Her small gestures loosened enormous fragments of the
universe and at the faint dying sound of her voice they had
fallen in ruins about him. His world was no longer safe,
it had ceased to stand on its foundations. Mrs. Viveash
walked among his ruins and did not even notice them.
He must build up again. Pedal, pedal. He was not
merely escaping; he was working a building machine. It
must be built with proportion; with proportion, the old
man had said. The old man appeared in the middle of the
nightmare road in front of him, clutching his beard. Proportion,
proportion. There were first a lot of dirty rocks
lying about; then there was St. Paul’s. These bits of his
life had to be built up proportionably.</p>
<p class="c010">There was work. And there was talk about work and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_324">324</span>ideas. And there were men who could talk about work
and ideas. But so far as he had been concerned that was
about all they could do. He would have to find out what
else they did; it was interesting. And he would have to
find out what other men did; men who couldn’t talk
about work and not much about ideas. They had as good
kidneys as any one else.</p>
<p class="c010">And then there were women.</p>
<p class="c010">On the nightmare road he remained stationary. The
pedals went round and round under his driving feet; the
sweat ran off him. He was escaping, and yet he was also
drawing nearer. He would have to draw nearer. “Woman,
what have I to do with you?” Not enough; too much.</p>
<p class="c010">Not enough—he was building her in, a great pillar next to
the pillar of work.</p>
<p class="c010">Too much—he was escaping. If he had not caged himself
here in this hot box, he would have run out after her,
to throw himself—all in fragments, all dissipated and
useless—in front of her. And she wanted none of him.
But perhaps it would be worse, perhaps it would be far,
far worse if she did.</p>
<p class="c010">The old man stood in the road before him, clutching his
beard, crying out, “Proportion, proportion.” He trod
and trod at his building machine, working up the pieces of
his life, steadily, unremittingly working them into a proportionable
whole, into a dome that should hang, light,
spacious and high, as though by a miracle, on the empty
air. He trod and trod, escaping, mile after mile into
fatigue, into wisdom. He was at Dover now, pedalling
across the Channel. He was crossing a dividing gulf and
there would be safety on the other side; the cliffs of Dover
were already behind him. He turned his head as though
<span class="pageno" id="Page_325">325</span>to look back at them; the drops of sweat were shaken from
his eyebrows, from the shaggy fringes of his moustache.
He turned his head from the blank wooden wall in front of
him over his left shoulder. A face was looking through the
observation window behind him—a woman’s face.</p>
<p class="c010">It was the face of Mrs. Viveash.</p>
<p class="c010">Shearwater uttered a cry and at once turned back again.
He redoubled his pedalling. One, two, three, four—furiously
he rushed along the nightmare road. She was
haunting him now in hallucinations. She was pursuing
and she was gaining on him. Will, wisdom, resolution and
understanding were of no avail, then? But there was always
fatigue. The sweat poured down his face, streamed down
the indented runnel of his spine, along the seam at the
meeting-place of the ribs. His loin-cloth was wringing wet.
The drops pattered continuously on the waterproof sheet.
His calves and the muscles of his thighs ached with pedalling.
One, two, three, four—he trod round a hundred times with
either foot. After that he ventured to turn his head once
more. He was relieved, and at the same time he was disappointed,
to see that there was now no face at the window.
He had exorcised the hallucination. He settled down to a
more leisurely pedalling.</p>
<p class="c010">In the annexe of the laboratory the animals devoted to
the service of physiology were woken by the sudden opening
of the door, the sudden irruption of light. The albino
guinea-pigs peered through the meshes of their hutch and
their red eyes were like the rear-lights of bicycles. The
pregnant she-rabbits lolloped out and shook their ears
and pointed their tremulous noses towards the door. The
cock into which Shearwater had engrafted an ovary came
out, not knowing whether to crow or cluck.</p>
<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_326">326</span>“When he’s with hens,” Lancing explained to his visitors,
“he thinks he’s a cock. When he’s with a cock, he’s convinced
he’s a pullet.”</p>
<p class="c010">The rats who were being fed on milk from a London
dairy came tumbling from their nest with an anxious hungry
squeaking. They were getting thinner and thinner every
day; in a few days they would be dead. But the old rat,
whose diet was Grade A milk from the country, hardly
took the trouble to move. He was as fat and sleek as a
brown furry fruit, ripe to bursting. No skim and chalky
water, no dried dung and tubercle bacilli for him. He was
in clover. Next week, however, the fates were plotting to
give him diabetes artificially.</p>
<p class="c010">In their glass pagoda the little black axolotls crawled, the
heraldry of Mexico, among a scanty herbage. The beetles,
who had had their heads cut off and replaced by the heads
of other beetles, darted uncertainly about, some obeying
their heads, some their genital organs. A fifteen-year-old
monkey, rejuvenated by the Steinach process, was discovered
by the light of Lancing’s electric torch, shaking
the bars that separated him from the green-furred, bald-rumped,
bearded young beauty in the next cage. He was
gnashing his teeth with thwarted passion.</p>
<p class="c010">Lancing expounded to the visitors all the secrets. The
vast, unbelievable, fantastic world opened out as he spoke.
There were tropics, there were cold seas busy with living
beings, there were forests full of horrible trees, silence and
darkness. There were ferments and infinitesimal poisons
floating in the air. There were leviathans suckling their
young, there were flies and worms, there were men, living
in cities, thinking, knowing good and evil. And all were
changing continuously, moment by moment, and each
<span class="pageno" id="Page_327">327</span>remained all the time itself by virtue of some unimaginable
enchantment. They were all alive. And on the other
side of the courtyard beyond the shed in which the animals
slept or uneasily stirred, in the huge hospital that went up
sheer like a windowed cliff into the air, men and women
were ceasing to be themselves, or were struggling to remain
themselves. They were dying, they were struggling to live.
The other windows looked on to the river. The lights
of London Bridge were on the right, of Blackfriars to the
left. On the opposite shore, St. Paul’s floated up as though
self-supported in the moonlight. Like time the river
flowed, silent and black. Gumbril and Mrs. Viveash
leaned their elbows on the sill and looked out. Like time
the river flowed, stanchlessly, as though from a wound
in the world’s side. For a long time they were silent.
They looked out, without speaking, across the flow of time,
at the stars, at the human symbol hanging miraculously
in the moonlight. Lancing had gone back to his German
book; he had no time to waste looking out of windows.</p>
<p class="c010">“To-morrow,” said Gumbril at last, meditatively.</p>
<p class="c010">“To-morrow,” Mrs. Viveash interrupted him, “will
be as awful as to-day.” She breathed it like a truth from
beyond the grave prematurely revealed, expiringly from her
death-bed within.</p>
<p class="c010">“Come, come,” protested Gumbril.</p>
<p class="c010">In his hot box Shearwater sweated and pedalled. He
was across the Channel now; he felt himself safe. Still
he trod on; he would be at Amiens by midnight if he went
on at this rate. He was escaping, he had escaped. He was
building up his strong light dome of life. Proportion, cried
the old man, proportion! And it hung there, proportioned
and beautiful in the dark, confused horror of his desires,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_328">328</span>solid and strong and durable among his broken thoughts.
Time flowed darkly past.</p>
<p class="c010">“And now,” said Mrs. Viveash, straightening herself
up, and giving herself a little shake, “now we’ll drive to
Hampstead and have a look at Piers Cotton.”</p>
